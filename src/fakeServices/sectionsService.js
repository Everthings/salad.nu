The course focuses on understanding how individuals, families, and groups acquire, consume, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, brands, and experiences. The goal is to deeply understand people's goals, what people actually do, the meanings behind their activities, and the experiences they seek in order to better understand them as consumers. To do this, we will examine psychological, economic, communications, anthropological and sociological perspectives on human action that will allow us to generate consumer insights.

For the past 50 years, however, agricultural and stormwater runoff has degraded the quality of the Everglades and threatened the Seminole people and endangered animals including the Florida panther, American crocodile, certain species of fish and wading birds. The Seminole have launched an ambitious $65 million project to improve the quality and quantity of water flowing off their Big Cypress Reservation into the Florida Everglades. Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become increasingly salient, as Indigenous communities struggle to defend their air, water, and other natural resources; protect their access to traditional foods; and adapt to changes in their landscapes.

Not only does foreign law matter to U.S. lawyers in international business or international arbitration, but it is important within national law (consider Chicago litigation involving a contract governed by French law or a Miami resident bequeathing real estate in Italy). Indeed, a comprehensive ABA survey reveals that after 7 years of practice, 44% of U.S. lawyers report work involving foreign law, a figure that reaches 66% for lawyers in large firms and 65% for those working as inside counsel. However, the \"handling\" of foreign law raises formidable challenges. Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a U.S. lawyer? How to optimize one's understanding of foreign law? Are there methods, techniques, or strategies that can overcome differences across laws, languages, and cultures ? that can give reliable access to foreign law's singularity? How best to proceed, and what can be achieved? Meanwhile, many claim that U.S. courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Note that this course, despite its focus, finds itself effectively ranging beyond the issue of foreign law.

While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.\"\n\nTo be sure, Hand was hopeful that a fierce commitment to liberty - along with a constellation of other critical constitutional values -- did course within the American people, reflecting and cementing the protections provided under law. But if Hand's optimism was (and is) well-placed, it bears asking: How have these constitutional values been forged within American hearts, minds, and culture? How have public conversations, discussions, and debates about the meaning of the United States Constitution unfolded? And what might those exchanges, located in our past, reveal about how Americans view the Constitution's guarantees within their own lives today?\n\nThis course, focused on American public constitutional discourse, will address these questions. Specifically, we will assess and compare the public persuasion dimensions of an eclectic series of constitutional controversies. Fusing legal history, rhetorical criticism, communication research, political science, and constitutional theory, we will analyze the public arguments advanced by advocates during these episodes, the methods used to do so, and their success or failure with key public audiences. \n\nWe will also investigate the discursive manner by which Americans - in print and at the podium, and across legislative hearing rooms, law school classrooms, and family living rooms -- have built a constitutional culture, and the degree to which that public culture: (a) informs individual and community expectations regarding freedom, democracy, and equality; (b) reinforces core constitutional precepts of rights, judicial legitimacy, institutional balance, and the rule of law; and (c) reflects, invites, and shapes the exercise of citizenship."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Students will achieve the following learning objectives: (1) understand the dueling public arguments, and key methods of communication, characterizing each case study's public constitutional debate; (2) engage in rhetorical criticism of the major speeches, movements, and arguments comprising these episodes; (3) develop insights into how public appeals recur, change, and adapt across U.S. constitutional history, and how skillful public advocates draw on prior debates to prevail in new ones; (4) assess the manner in which public debates, key texts, social movements, and rhetorical framings reflect and affect public understanding of the Constitution; and (5) develop insights into contemporary constitutional controversies, including elements of effective public advocacy regarding American law."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"This course will operate in a part-lecture, part-discussion format.

Working with an Ethiopian NGO and U.S. and Canadian partner NGOs, we'll be continuing advocacy efforts on behalf of an indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination (mercury, arsenic, etc.) from the Lega Dembi gold mine. Details of what we'll do depend on evolving circumstances, but we may write submissions to UN human rights mechanisms, continue our efforts to force the government to make public the results of impact assessments, utilize European laws and regulations or industry self-regulatory standards with respect to the supply chain obligations of the Swiss refinery that has purchased the gold from this mine, and explore possibilities within the African HR system. 2. We have been asked by two women's rights NGOs in Myanmar to analyze the results of a survey questionnaire on the security situation of women in Myanmar following the military coup, to write a report based on these results, and to engage in international advocacy using the report. 3. We are collaborating with EQUAL GROUND, a Sri Lanka LGBTIQ NGO, to prepare submissions for the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Human Rights Council's UPR mechanism regarding human rights violations against LGVTIQ people in Sri Lanka.  4.  Working with the newly-founded Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability, we will continue work begun last year to determine whether grounds exist to hold corporate actors in the gold and diamond sectors criminally liable for complicity in crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic. 5. We may add another project - perhaps in collaboration with a legal clinic in either Arequipa, Peru, or Tbilisi, Georgia.  Do you have an idea of a HR project you would like to work on? I am always open to student suggestions for projects that are suitable for this clinic, though whether we can proceed with an idea this coming semester depends on time demands of all projects."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"PRE-REQ: IHR LLMs need advance instructor permission to bid.

We will learn to do this through methods of design sketching used by industrial designers. The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.\n \nWe will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.\n \nWe will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources.

We encounter services on a daily basis, across industries such as retail, travel, banking, and health-care. Even product-based organizations and offerings often have an important element of service that can be a driver of their success. While services dominate our everyday experience, many of them are in desperate need of redesigning and often complete rethinking. Organizations are waking up to this and increasingly seeing service design, not as a cost center, but as an opportunity for growth.\n\nDuring our class together, we will explore the improvement of existing services and the creation of new services. We will address the challenges and opportunities when it comes to designing for services, by exploring the underlying principles, traditional methods and tools, and newer frontiers of what it means to deeply understand people's needs, goals and aspirations, and to orchestrate a human-centered, responsive, and compelling service experience.

ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. \n\nThis course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.\n\nIn ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow ? the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc.\n\nTopics Include:\n\n? Steady viscous flows (exact solutions)\n           Poiseuille flow in round pipes\n           Couette flow between parallel plates\n? Inviscid flows \n           concept of vorticity and the generalized Bernoulli theorem\n           irrotational (or potential) flows - the velocity potential and the stream function\n?

The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven&#39s music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century. This course aims to better understand Beethoven&#39s music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven&#39s vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven&#39s expansion of music genres; exploring important performers of Beethoven&#39s music; understanding connections between Beethoven&#39s music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today in a global context. Although it is a fairly large 300-level class, it will be run as a pro-seminar, meaning graduate-level group discussion of scholarly readings from upper level academic journals, and independent research work, is expected of all students.

This foreign \"occupation\" continues well into the 19th century, but by the second half of that century begins to yield to a vigorous new school of French composers who created a series of extraordinarily successful works. Some of these (Bizet&#39s <em>Carmen</em>) are still popular today, others have faded somewhat (Gounod&#39s <em>Faust</em>, Massenet&#39s <em>Manon</em>), and still others have virtually vanished from the repertoire (<em>Mignon</em> by Ambroise Thomas, <em>Lakm&eacute;</em> by Leo Delibes).  Amid these shifting sands, the tradition of grand opera as embodied in the works of Hal&eacute;vy and Meyerbeer have undergone a strong reassessment, while at the opposite end, the operettas of Offenbach carry on in an absurd, satirical, and delightful world of their own. In this course, we will explore a selection of these works against the background of French history from Napoleon to the end of the 19th century.

Yet there has been considerable critique of stress as the defining feature of adolescence, and recently researchers have focused on the many strengths, assets, and opportunities of adolescents and this developmental period (National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2019). The experience and consequences of stress do, however, represent important features of adolescence, as well as early adulthood. While complete coverage of the extensive literature on adolescent and young adult stress is not possible, in this course, we will begin to explore some central questions: Why are adolescence and early adulthood stressful periods of life? Are they more stressful now than in the past? How do we define and best measure adolescent and young adult stress? What are the key sources of stress during these developmental periods? What are the major biological stress response systems of the body, and how are they impacted by stress and normative developmental change? What are the implications of stress, and biological stress responses, for adolescent and young adult health and developmental outcomes? What factors reduce adolescent stress and its impact on youth outcomes? How might this knowledge be leveraged to develop and implement interventions to improve the wellbeing of adolescents and young adults? \n\n \n\nThis course is an advanced, interactive, undergraduate class in which the instructor and students explore this set of questions (and more) together, through lecture, readings, and discussions. An additional aim of the course is to familiarize students with key research methods and quantitative analyses used in adolescent stress research. Students will have the opportunity to pose their own questions and hypotheses regarding adolescent stress and examine these hypotheses empirically (based on available data). Ultimately, the joint goals are to a) teach students about the science and current knowledge regarding adolescent stress, b) have students begin to get comfortable posing and answering questions using data analyses, and c) to help reduce student stress through increased understanding of stress and factors that contribute to and reduce stress.?"}]},{"unique_id":"29432","instructors":["Lilah Devra Shapiro"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics in Human Development in Context","subject":"HDC","number":"351-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"15:20","room":{"building_name":"Annenberg Hall 345"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Fundamental to nearly all life experiences is a) who we are - who we understand ourselves to be and who others think we are, b) the organizations and groups of which we are a part, and c) the co-construction and myriad entanglements and interactions of these things.

For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors ? for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change."}]}],"019005":[{"unique_id":"29435","instructors":["Reed   Stevens"],"mode":null,"title":"Redesigning Everyday Organizations","subject":"LOC","number":"308-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"9:30","end_time":"12:20","room":{"building_name":"Annenberg Hall 303"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"In our everyday lives, we learn and work within particular arrangements of people, objects, tools, and information.

By examining characteristics of youth and community programs in the fields of education, social justice, human development, health promotion, human rights, and civic engagement - at the local, national, and international levels - we will seek to identify commonalities and understand differences among them. A key goal of this course is to acquire an intellectual and applied understanding of the principles of program design and development, which include a sustained consideration of issues affecting the quality of program implementation. Considerable attention will be devoted to specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of actual programs. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration; identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; staff selection; setting global and incremental goals; and ensuring sustainability. We must also acknowledge that what counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex and that programs can therefore be controversial, difficult to manage, and difficult to evaluate. In light of this, we will touch on the organizational, ethical, and political contexts of implementation.

It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.\n\nThe first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents."}]}],"000643":[{"unique_id":"29700","instructors":["Sally Afia Nuamah"],"mode":null,"title":"Race, Inequality, and the Political Analysis of Public Policy","subject":"SOC_POL","number":"313-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Annenberg Hall 345"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"The purpose of this course is to make students a better political analyst.

The course begins by critically attending to a set of techno-economic features of globalization, and then addressing cultural and political issues that arise with globalization.  The course will focus on following four topics: the new dynamics of global production, the new dynamics of global marketing and consumption, the new dynamics of circulation and cultural economy, and the new geography of jobs and economic inequality. Since we live in a world primarily structured and propelled by global capitalism, we will (while discussing topics noted above) focus on a group of intriguing and powerful global corporations and their practices (both commercial and cultural): Amazon, Apple, Walmart, Uber, and others. The current phase of globalization (becoming dominant and noticeable in1990s) has been accompanied by a socio-political reaction called \"the anti-globalization\" movement.  This is not a monolithic movement.  It has many strands and differing agendas. This movement, in its initial phase was largely dominated by the activists from the political left.  However, in its current phase the anti-globalization movements in Europe and USA are often led by the political right as evident from BREXIT and the election of Donald Trump.

From the ways we socialize with friends and family, to the way we engage in work and leisure, to the way we procure food? media and technology play a key role in structuring our everyday lives and activities. In turn these media objects, and the messages which they communicate, play a key role in shaping our understanding of the social, political, and economic systems around us. But how, in what ways, and to what extent does media structure our social realities? And further, what role do we as individuals and as audiences play in both getting meaning from and giving meaning to the media messages?\nThroughout this course, we will attempt to answer these questions as we examine the way mass media messages get constructed, circulated, and repurposed throughout popular culture; as well as the way these media messages help structure popular understandings of ideology within society. Beginning with early theorization on the relationship between media and society and the concept of media effects and medium theory, we will trace the way theories about the relationship between mass media and the audience have evolved within the field of communications studies, from a one-sided theory of media effects, to a cultural exchange between the needs and wants of audiences as specifically-socially located agents. Throughout this course, we will also interrogate how media messages become ?popular' and what characteristics of media messages lend themselves to popular, pleasurable, and negotiated readings.\nIn line with the goals of this Communications Studies 394 writing seminar, throughout the course students will also be learning how to go about conceiving, developing, and crafting their own original research papers. Students will engage in in-class peer review workshops and short writing assignments that will help guide them in the research and writing process.

Fred wanted to expand from media studies into science and technology studies (STS), while I was embarked on the inverse intellectual journey, from STS to media studies. There was a burgeoning literature beginning to explore the intersection of these two fields, in particular on issues having to do with the development and use of information and communication technologies. However, it dawned on us that there was little in the way of a systematic attempt to think programmatically about that intersection across and beyond specific projects. Thus, to explore what that intersection might look like, Fred and I convened a series of panels at the annual meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science (2003) and the International Communication Association (2004). Inspired by the discussions at those panels and in other venues and texts, I began teaching a doctoral seminar under \"Media Meet Technology\" title at Northwestern in fall 2005. Since then, various iterations of the seminar have focused on different issues, but a few elements have remained constant over the years: a) the presence of readings from media studies and STS, b) the combination of contemporary and historical scholarship; and c) the focus on the material and content dimensions of information and communication technologies. For the winter 2022 iteration the focus will be on \"Ethnographies of Media Practice Across the Americas.\" We will examine work on nine countries across the continent?Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and the United States?and pay special attention to cross-national patterns of similarity and difference in topical foci, theoretical framing, and argumentation structures."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"No textbook required."}]},{"unique_id":"28624","instructors":["Moya Z Bailey"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics Research Seminar","subject":"MTS","number":"525-0","section":"27","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"16:30","end_time":"19:20","room":{"building_name":"Frances Searle Building 3220"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"How can we ethically engage a military-derived technology that has infiltrated every aspect of our lives from refrigerators to furniture?

Students will be asked to demonstrate their comprehension and knowledge of the material through participation, discussion, short quizzes, sequencing assignments, and a final project.

Conversations about race and media are often dominated by notions of stereotype, positive or negative representation, color-blindness or racial specificity. But even as those frameworks offer important and productive ways of thinking through constructions of race in the media, they often rely on and reinscribe distinct and stable racial categories. However, media can also disrupt the very categories on which those hierarchies depend. Contemporary depictions of interracial sex and romance may map continued anxieties about the danger and appeal of crossing the color line (think Get Out), or they may celebrate colorblindness as a virtue and idealize the mixed-race nuclear family (think Cheerios commercials). We will consider how sexuality is deployed in such depictions to re- or de-stabilize racial categories and hierarchies. Taking representations as diverse as Key & Peele's playful deployments of whiteface, Scarlett Johansson and Emma Stone's notorious turns as Asian or Asian-American characters, and the social media phenomena of \"blackfishing,\" we will interrogate the stakes of transracial performance. We will also analyze the racialized transformation of idealized masculinity and femininity in our \"post-racial\" media landscape. By examining celebrities whose ambiguously  racialized identities shift across and through performance, from Keanu Reeves to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, and Jennifer Lopez to Kim Kardashian, we will ask what mixed-race identity does to gender, sexuality, and class. Scholarly readings in the course will provide a foundation for understanding historical and contemporary racial formations and a basis in critical mixed-race studies, while press coverage will situate media texts, including celebrity personae, in the context of our everyday understanding of race.

Audiences from all over the world met the expansion of American TV with both enthusiasm and resistance, and US program exports exceeded those of any other nation. Early television scholars equated the omnipresence of US TV with its cultural influence and objected to what they saw as cultural imperialism. By 1980s and 1990s, US television increasingly turned to international co-productions, as these projects carried both financial and cultural benefits. In contemporary televisual landscape, international co-productions, global television format circulations, and internationalization of streaming services reflect the increasingly transnational needs of the global marketplace. In this course, we will examine the dynamics and cultural implications of television's global reach.\n\nWe will begin by tracing the rise of US television on a global scale from the Cold War to the contemporary moment.

What is widely considered the first known photograph, created by Joseph Niepce c. 1826, was the view out the window of his family home in Burgundy, France. Similarly, one of the earliest films ever made, the Lumi?re Brothers' Le Repas de B?b? (1895), shows Auguste Lumi?re, his wife, and their child having breakfast at their home in the French countryside. And while the historical connections between visual media and family run deep, there is a new poignance in the role that familial media plays in our current climate. In the throes of civil uprisings and an ongoing global pandemic, familial media helps console the loss of loved ones, intervenes in isolation, and connects us with our communities despite enforced social distancing. This historical survey course on the ethics and theory of familial media situates our contemporary social media explosion in a long and rich tradition of visual media influencing what we mean when we talk about family.\nThis course examines how identity, home, and broader notions of belonging have developed as a result of, and in response to, changing visual representations of the family. Starting with the Lumi?re brothers' self-representation in Le Repas de B?b?, we will also critique the Lumi?res' later ethnographic films that violently misrepresent Indigenous families from the Global South. We will examine home movies that produce nostalgia for family history alongside first-person documentaries addressing familial abuse and trauma. Analyzing the role an audience plays in the production of familial media, we will compare private video diaries addressing one's own identity formation with YouTube vloggers publicly circulating the minutiae of their everyday lives. Lastly, we will interrogate how social media provides new possibilities for visually representing changing notions of what family can and does look like today."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"By the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\n?\tBroadly define the function of amateur media across the twentieth century \n?\tIdentify and assess technological, social, and historical trends in familial representation\n?\tUnderstand the relationship between homemade media and broader cultural currents\n?\tReflect on how familial media has helped shape their own sense of self"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Working computer, internet access, NU email/account, word processing program.\n\nAll course materials will be available online via Canvas."}]}],"004348":[{"unique_id":"24822","instructors":["Ariel Rebecca Rogers"],"mode":null,"title":"History of Film I","subject":"RTVF","number":"312-1","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"11:50","room":{"building_name":"Helmerich Auditorium"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course surveys the history of international cinema from its emergence through the 1950s.

This course will develop basic skills in designing dramatic and dynamic relationships between performers and camera through hands-on exercises in class and shooting in the field. You will introduce and practice different styles of coverage (for example, long-take vs. analytical montage) and camera technique (dolly vs. handheld vs. tripod).

This will include digging into how a production itself sustains meaning making, methods for researching artistic intent, and ways to think about the relationship between process and product.

An empty stage is available to each artist, they can choose a myriad of things to fill it with, arrange it as they like, and tell the story of their choice.  In light of this much freedom, the student needs to make strong choices about the aesthetic path they are going to take.  The form exposes any kind of vagary, sloppiness, lack of cohesion and generality.  Because students are working alone on this project, they alone must make those choices and commit fully to their own vision. This is most valuable because directors and designers must own their own point of view about the world and the story they are telling, and they must be able to defend it using visual metaphor.

The full draft will be read out loud in class and MFA and advanced undergraduate directing students will workshop and present scenes from the play. Students will serve as actors during the reading and workshopping of the play. Playwriting students will be expected to workshop a recent work. An older project may be workshopped if it has undergone significant revisions. This is the first part of a two part class. The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased. ?In addition to second and third year graduate directors, this class is open to undergraduate Junior and Senior advanced directing students by permission only.  Your participation in New Play Collab I will automatically guarantee you a spot in New Play Collab II in the Spring, where you will direct a workshop of one of the selected plays for the New Work Festival.  Please only apply if you can commit to taking the course both Winter and Spring quarters.

Specifically, this course helps us think critically about the long history of solidarity politics and forms as well as their future, and even about the terms \"solidarity\"  [?????]. and \"aesthetics\" [???????] themselves.   \n\nWhat can we learn from historical examples of connected movements in order to understand the way in which allegiance and disidentification are articulated through multiple aesthetic platforms and modalities?  What can aesthetics teach us about the possibilities and limits of shared imaginations and political aspirations? Additionally, we ask how activists, artists, and scholars mobilize the aesthetic and the linguistic to address tensions in translocal solidarities between national or local specificities and singularities on the one hand, and shared or cognate experiences and structures on the other? Are \"solidarity\" and \"aesthetics\" even the most accurate or desirable terms to describe such diverse movements as they exist in the history of connected struggles across the long 20th century (from third worldism of the mid-century to more contemporary actions such as DecolonizeThis Place/BDS)?\n\nOur investigations will bring us to study literary texts, manifestos, journals, art works and projects, scholarly debates, and films emanating from or concerned with the formerly (or still) colonized regions of the Middle East.\n\nThis class includes a professionalization component in that it culminates in a symposium of 20 minute presentations from all class members, the texts of which are to be handed in for graded assessment which feeds into final grades, otherwise equally based on class participation and contextual research presentations.

Ethnographic understanding emerges through human exchange and collaborative meaning making, both between the anthropologist and research participants (participation) and between individuals in the field of investigation or fieldsite (observation). What does it mean, then, to do ethnography in the archives? Archives -- inscribed traces of lived worlds left by people - seeming cannot speak back to the reader. Without this lived exchange, what can we learn from documents created historically for administrative purposes of states or colonial empires? In this graduate seminar, we consider both narratives of state domination through text creation and possible stories about actions of individuals in non-dominant social groups, especially women, children, the poor, and ethnic minorities. Rather than adopting purely an anti-empirical approach to archived texts, we consider ways in which the bureaucratic scribe's record is both situated fact and angled purpose, and how documents' potential stories exceed their intended purposes.

What are appropriate punishments for crimes?) and in our wider literary culture (What makes a text worthy or not worthy of being considered literature? Who makes these literary \"laws\"?)

We will explore human behavior from a biological, psychological and socio-cultural perspective. We will discuss the history of psychology beginning with an overview of psychology's roots, observing how prevailing paradigms have shifted throughout the centuries. We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored. Finally, we try to uncover group dynamics that can give rise to pathological and sometimes destructive behavior as that observed in cults.

In this course, we will debate what exactly \"Reality TV\" denotes, considering industrial and technological developments alongside aesthetic, narrative, and representational strategies. We will review how media and cultural theory have been used to make sense of and critique reality television. We will engage concepts such as documentary ethics, surveillance, interactivity, lifestyle, taste, labor, and identity.

Since Phillis Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773), the very first publication by an African American in the United States, black writers have engaged with classical works by Greek and Roman authors. During this class, we will read selections from Black Classicist writers and the referent texts (in translation). We will explore the variety of fiction and poetry from Phillis Wheatley, Ovid, Pauline E. Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Euripides, as well as more recent work by Toni Morrison, Donika Kelly, and Kwame Dawes & Matthew Shenoda. As a class, we will create our own set of unique inquiries and explore the answers to, at least, the following questions: How do \"the classics\" inform the stories by African American authors? What kinds of capital do classical themes, plotlines, and symbolism create for Black classicist writers? What assumptions can we make about Black authors who rewrite classical works? In what ways are those assumptions affirmed and exploded through our semester-long literary inquiry? In what ways does Black classicism alter the way we understand the classical texts to which it refers? \n\nAssignments include regular online discussions, a mid-term paper, a group presentation, and an individual or group final project and presentation.

The division into two territories -one Hindu-majority, the other Muslim-majority - was accompanied by perhaps the largest migration in human history. Millions moved from one territory to the other, often against their will, as hundreds of thousands were killed in the ensuing chaos. The unprecedented violence of Partition - physical, emotional, social - profoundly shaped the national identities of India and Pakistan, permanently restructured the texture of everyday life and altered the global political order. From the subsequent partitioning of Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1971, to enduring border disputes in Kashmir, from ongoing cross-border migration to unresolved conflicts over identity and belonging, Partition continue to shape the region today. Partition's legacy today extends far beyond the heavily-fortified frontier and into the art, literature and popular culture of the three countries that emerged from it. Even as the post-colonial states treated Partition as an aberration best forgotten - a footnote of a midnight tryst with destiny - the arts emerged as the primary space in which the meaning of Partition was negotiated and mediated. What could not easily be engaged directly found its expression, often allegorically, on the silver screen or the off-white pages of literary magazines. This class will examine how Partition has been engaged in literature and popular culture, moving from contemporary depictions from the 1940s to its continued invocation in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today. We will read/watch these texts alongside the extensive body of scholarship on Partition from History, Anthropology and Gender Studies with particular attention to the historiography of Partition and South Asian nationalisms.

Students are expected to begin the course with a clear research topic (or multiple possible topics) and a rough idea of what primary sources they may use to develop it.

What can aesthetics teach us about the possibilities and limits of shared imaginations and political aspirations? Additionally, we ask how activists, artists, and scholars mobilize the aesthetic and the linguistic to address tensions in translocal solidarities between national or local specificities and singularities on the one hand, and shared or cognate experiences and structures on the other? Are \"solidarity\" and \"aesthetics\" even the most accurate or desirable terms to describe such diverse movements as they exist in the history of connected struggles across the long 20th century (from third worldism of the mid-century to more contemporary actions such as DecolonizeThis Place/BDS)?\n\nOur investigations will bring us to study literary texts, manifestos, journals, art works and projects, scholarly debates, and films emanating from or concerned with the formerly (or still) colonized regions of the Middle East.\n\nThis class includes a professionalization component in that it culminates in a symposium of 20 minute presentations from all class members, the texts of which are to be handed in for graded assessment which feeds into final grades, otherwise equally based on class participation and contextual research presentations.

For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the \"holes of oblivion.\"  Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work:  faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions?  Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity:  from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action.  As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity?namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"?we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized.  This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness.   As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."}]},{"unique_id":"29635","instructors":["Maria Alejandra Uslenghi"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics in Comparative Literature","subject":"COMP_LIT","number":"488-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Kresge Centennial Hall 2-343"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course offers an overview of 20th century avant-garde movements in Europe and the Americas analyzing the historical contexts in which they emerged.

We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network.

The economic approach to law assumes that punishments such as incarceration or fines are implicit prices for violating the law. According to this view, these prices may be chosen in such a way that will yield the most socially desirable outcome. Of course, it may not be appropriate to judge laws entirely based on their economic efficiency. For example, it may also be appropriate to consider outcomes that are \"fair\" or \"just,\" however defined, and these outcomes may not be the most efficient. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that efficiency is one important criterion for purposes of judging the law. Given that economists are often interested in studying incentives, it is therefore quite natural that we might be both interested and perhaps even well-equipped to analyze various areas of the law. Along these lines, we will seek to employ simple economic models in order to understand the efficiency of laws in several areas, including torts, contracts, property, and crime. In studying these diverse areas of the law, the economic approach to understanding the law will be consistent throughout, and will allow us to study these different areas of the law in a unified manner."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Economics 281, 310-1, 2"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"N/A"},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Lectures, discussion, and discussion of problem sets"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Two midterms (25% each), three problem sets (10% total), and a final exam (40%)."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"The Economic Approach to Law by Thomas J.

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.

It will be at most three pages, should include a main hypothesis/research question(s), brief overview of the relevant literature, description of potential data to be used, and empirical strategy that would best answer your hypothesis. More guidelines will be provided later. At least one of the four problem sets will involve the use of Stata. Also, at the end of every problem set I will ask you a couple questions that will help you think about a potential research idea based on the concepts covered in the problem set.

The idea of \"the human/animal divide\" constantly re-appears, despite the way evolutionary models show community of descent. But a closer look at writers across history shows how a persistent, cross-species curiosity works in the other direction to attribute allegedly human powers to non-human creatures. Are we anthropomorphizing other creatures when we see likeness or symmetry between us? Or are we counting ourselves as an animal among other animals? On the other hand, when we see differences between \"us and them,\" why should that difference normally be in our favor? This course takes up the core philosophical problem of \"self and other\" in what may be its most dramatic case.

Not simply enchanting or magical fantasies, fairy tales emerged from oral storytelling traditions to reflect cultures' deepest desires and darkest fears.  Fairy tales offer us characters onto whom we can project our own fantasies or anxieties as well as narratives that we can interpret - and reinterpret - across time periods and places to help us understand personal and cultural moments.  This course will investigate the theme of transformation in fairy tales and myths to ask questions about identity, gender, sexuality, and our relationship to the environment.  We will explore not only how fairy tales represent cultural investments, but also how fairy tales cross boundaries to offer critiques of societal norms.  For instance, the genre of \"feminist fairy tales\" reworks traditional stories to critique patriarchal structures and privilege female agency.  At the same time, we will ask how fairy tales and myths - which so many of us have been immersed in since childhood - shape the lens through which we see the world and the narratives we tell ourselves about our lives.  We will juxtapose modern retellings with traditional tales of transformation from Ovid's Metamorphoses, Arabian Nights, Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen.

In the year of the pandemic, European nations voted for strict vaccine export control measures, effectively slowing down access to medications for the Global South. Phrases like \"vaccine nationalism\" as well as \"vaccine passports\" have become commonplace. This twilight zone of deepening crises, and the imperial paranoid imaginary of what Neel Ahuja calls \"bioinsecurities,\" have long been represented by science fiction authors. Keeping a firm eye on epidemiology, race, and imperialism, this course charts a path along genre-bending, speculative fictions that imagine contagion and infection from the late-nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. Contagion emerges not just as a moral panic or embodied paranoia about infection, but as a method of relationality that draws tightly controlled, governmentalized worlds around raced and differentiated bodies. We will think about how these fictional netherworlds produce new subjectivities of life, death, and living death. Alongside science fictional as well as speculative novels, spanning postcolonial as well as US writing, we will also watch films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, District 9, Arrival, World War Z, and Contagion."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Bram Stoker, Dracula\nAlbert Camus, The Plague\nAmitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome\nColson Whitehead, Zone One\nLing Ma, Severance"}]},{"unique_id":"26597","instructors":["Samantha Jo Botz"],"mode":null,"title":"First-Year Seminar","subject":"ENGLISH","number":"101-6","section":"25","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"University Hall 318"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Haunting the human imagination, the monstrous eludes precise definition, always standing for something else: something lurking beneath the surface, or just out of sight.

In this course, we will investigate both ends of this equally captivating and complicated monstrous spectrum by reading a selection of short fictions by women that similarly elude genre categorization and delight in the inexplicable and the odd. From the mothers of the Gothic novel, Mary Shelley and Charlotte Dacre, to contemporary masters of unsettling short fictions like Octavia Butler and Carmen Maria Machado, we will trace how women writers have long turned to the supernatural, uncanny, and odd to respond to issues of gender, sexuality, race, class, and ability.

Today we take science writing as an objective, transparent transcription of experimental data.  However, during the Scientific Revolution in Europe and Britain, literary form was vital to the transmission and popularization of new experimental methods.  Indeed, literary representation was necessary to help people conceive new sensory worlds at microscopic, sub-microscopic, or planetary scale.  In HUM 370/ ENG 385, we will explore the centrality of literary representation to pivotal new technologies in the early modern emergence of experimental science:  the microscope, the air-pump, the telescope, and the distillation apparatus.  These technologies did not only challenge fervently held convictions about the natural world endorsed by the Bible, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, among other authorities.  They also demanded new representational modes able to communicate concepts and vivify experiences inassimilable to old ways of understanding.  How can the pervasive agency of atmospheric pressure be figured in language?  What words make the magnified body of a flea familiar, even beautiful?  Why poeticize the chemical reactions involved in refining a new global commodity, sugar?  What political viewpoints accompany Copernican visions of possible planetary worlds?\n\nWe will explore how literary technology was as integral to the New Science as experimental technology.  Throughout, we will approach western science not as universal knowledge but as highly situated practice, whose multifarious economic, extractive, and imperial investments are woven into the fabric of its literary representation.  We will dedicate significant time to satires of the new science, whose critical counter-representations of the frivolity, futility, or cruelty of experimental method illuminate the deep and ongoing stakes of science's relation to literature.\n\nThe class will be broken into interconnected units organized around the air-pump, microscope, distillation apparatus, and telescope.  Literary genres will include descriptions of experiments (including those in a new venue, the scientific journal), treatises, illustrated books, engravings, poems, satires, and plays.  A list of texts by unit follows (some excerpted).  Air-pump:  Robert Boyle, experiments from New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air (1660) and Continuation (1669); Thomas Shadwell, The Virtuoso (1676); Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the Plague Year (1722); John Arbuthnot, Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies (1733).  Microscope:  Robert Hooke, Micrographia (1665); Margaret Cavendish, Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (1668); Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels (1726).  Distillation Apparatus:  Robert Boyle, Origins of Forms and Qualities (1666); John Webster, Metallographia (1671); John Woodward, An Account of the Universal Deluge (1695) and Some Thoughts and Experiments concerning Vegetation (1699); John Phillips, Cyder. A Poem in Two Books (1708); Thomas Grainger, Sugar-Cane (1764).  Telescope:  Galileo Galilei, Starry Messenger (1610); Aphra Behn, A Discovery of New Worlds (1688); Eliza Haywood, Eovaai, Princess of Ijaveo (1736).  The telescope unit will conclude with one contemporary science fictional text, pending class consensus, which engages the contemporary stakes of envisioning new worlds (Ursula K.

Do we even have to ask?  English 397 will investigate this seemingly obvious literary mode.  First, we will explore the conventional wisdom that realism emerges alongside the rise of modern science:  just as experiment becomes the standard of scientific truth, so early fiction bases its claim to be truth-like on its simulation of experimental testimony.  We'll read one exemplar of experimental witnessing, the travel narrative, in both true and fictional forms:  the privateer William Dampier's A New Voyage Around the World (1697) and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719).  We will accompany these texts with short readings of scientific experiments (from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and Robert Boyle's New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air) as well as some contemporary theories of the rise of the novel.  We will then read Olaudah Equiano's The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789), which recounts its author's enslavement, displacement, manumission, and further voyages, to examine how Equiano redeploys the tropes of the travel narrative to argue for abolition. \n\nTurning to nineteenth-century realism and beyond, we will read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) to consider its treatment of perceptual evidence, the founding premise of the realist mode.  How does Austen complicate or even reject sensory self-evidence as the basis for knowledge?  We will then read one classic of French realism, Honor? de Balzac's Lost Illusions or P?re Goriot (in English), alongside canonical critical takes on realism by Georg Luk?cs, Fredric Jameson, and Roland Barthes.  In the course's penultimate unit, we will consider the status of the real in contemporary science studies.  We will examine the constructivist-realist debate in the history and sociology of science (readings by Thomas Kuhn, Ian Hacking, Steven Shapin, and Bruno Latour), whereby scientific truth may be a function of social convention.  We will be attuned to claims that it is the literary aspects of science that mask the constructedness of scientific truth?claims we will be in a good position to examine.  We end the quarter with two contemporary novels that challenge the capacity of realist literary convention to capture marginalized realities:  Miriam Toews's Women Talking and Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad.  What, we will ask, is the literary and social currency of realism today?  Has realism internalized a capacity to reflect critically on the reality that it claims faithfully to represent?\n\nAs a research seminar, this iteration of English 397 affords a range of prospective topics for a long research essay, extending from realism's founding texts through nineteenth-century realism, science studies, and contemporary feminist and antiracist appropriations of realism.  We will dedicate sustained class time to the tasks of articulating an essay topic, developing a bibliography, and structuring and drafting an argument.

Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity:  from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action.  As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity?namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"?we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized.  This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness.   As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."}]}],"014180":[{"unique_id":"28687","instructors":["Nicholas K Davis"],"mode":null,"title":"Studies in Literary Theory and Criticism","subject":"ENGLISH","number":"481-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"We","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"University Library 4722"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course uses an archive of films produced and/or released between 1998 and 2002 to construct a specifically cinematic and more broadly cultural history of the shift into a new millennium.

Efforts to reduce emissions are well-intentioned attempts to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, but have yet to spur the magnitude of action required. In this course we will explore the intersections of climate science, traditional ecological knowledge, and climate justice to unpack how different knowledge systems inform and impact effective climate governance and policy. Often unrecognized in science and policy arenas, traditional ecological knowledge generates insights for strengthening efforts to effectively address climate change. In this course, we ask: to what extent and how do different knowledge systems gain and lose traction in different climate policy arenas? How, why, and with what effects are the science and policy of climate change far removed from the people most vulnerable to its impacts? Is the exclusivity of science?marginalization of knowledge systems and extricating climate science from climate change experiences?the greatest threat to effective climate action? And, how might policy arenas facilitate the introduction, deliberation, and circulation of plural worldviews and knowledge systems?\n\nIn this research seminar, students will directly engage with an ongoing collaborative research project that seeks to answer these questions. The seminar is structured to reflect the research process. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, data analysis, and execution. In the first part of the course, we begin by first identifying and engaging with the empirical puzzles around science and knowledge in global climate governance to formulate a series of questions that emerge from these puzzles. We will engage the literature on global climate governance, climate policy, and knowledge politics, explore different research methods and approaches, including ethnography, content and discourse analysis, and quantitative interpretation of qualitative data. Each student will then conduct a mini-literature review on one of our broader questions and propose a research question, hypothesis (argument), and methodological strategy for carrying out the research. In the second part of the course, we will work to develop data collection and analysis skills. In the third part of the course, we complete the execution of the project, with each student developing and strengthening analytical writing skills by producing an original research paper."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Attendance at first class is required"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"By the end of this course, students will be able to: \n(1) Develop empirical insights about the relationships between climate science, climate justice, and climate governance\n(2) Devise appropriate methodological approaches for analyzing diverse types of data \n(3) Design, plan, and produce a problem-based empirical research paper \n(4) Integrate collaborative approaches in learning, leadership, and problem-solving endeavors \n(5) Seek and cultivate meaningful modes of engagement to advance learning"},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Seminar and field work"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"1) Research project, including literature review, research design, data collection and analysis, final research paper (70%)\n2) Participation and contributions to collective learning (30%)"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"(1) Smith, Linda Tuhiwai.

While the world community and individual countries have formulated policies to address climate change, these policies are almost universally recognized as being wholly inadequate to effectuate the objective of the Paris Agreement to hold global temperatures to well below 2?C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5?C. This has led to increasing calls for research and development, and potential deployment, of so-called \"climate geoengineering\" options, defined as \"deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's natural systems to counteract climate change.\" This includes \"solar radiation management\" (SRM) approaches that seek to cool the Earth by deflecting income solar radiation back to space by approaches such as dispersing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere and brightening clouds, as well as carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches that seek to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it, or utilize it for production of products or energy. These options include nature-based solutions, e.g. tree planting or enhancing soil uptake of carbon, direct air capture through the use of filtration systems, and ocean-based approaches. \n\nThis course will assess to examine the case for climate geoengineering as a third component to address climate change, alongside mitigation and adaptation, as well as a granular assessment of the potential effectiveness and risks of the most widely discussed approaches.

The free and open-source R programming language has become a powerful tool in data analysis in scientific research. This course offers an introduction to the fundamentals of data science using the programming language, R. The course contents span from basic R programming skills to advanced skills including data management, visualization and analysis of spatial data such as weather and satellite imagery data. By conducting hands-on exercises and an extensive project, students will develop dynamic and reproducible outputs based on their own fields of interests. This course does not require prior coding experience."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"There are no prerequisites for this course."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Students will recognize the fundamentals of R programming language.\nStudents will read, clean, merge and transform data attributes appropriately.\nStudents will effectively display and communicate spatial, temporal and textual data.\nStudents will process, analyze and interpret spatial data using R program.\nStudents will apply R data science skills into analyzing and presenting cases based on real-world problems."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"The course will focus on programming in the R language.

The idea is not new. Twentieth century French thought has produced robust and sustained reflections on how to understand and relate to the everyday as a cultural and ideological field. Yet, much of these thoughts are set aside and forgotten, naturalizing our relationship to what is actually produced and constructed in such a way as to do specific ideological work. This course will return to this practice of reading and deciphering our everyday myths.  \n\nThe course is organized around Mythologies postcoloniales (2018) which has recently received a great deal of attention given the urgency of the debates about legacies of colonialism and racism in the public space both in the United States and around the world. In this book, Etienne Achille and Lydie Moudelino reflect on names and legacies of public spaces in France, such as streets, through the lens of colonial history and historiographical and interpretative methods informed by Roland Barthes' famous Mythologies (1957). We will therefore begin by reading segments of Mythologies in order to understand both the ways in which the notion of \"mythology\" is defined by Roland Barthes and his distinct method of reading cultural and everyday objects and practices, uncovering their ideological substrata. We will then read Mythologies postcoloniales to understand its particular angle in mobilizing this method to critique the legacies of colonial history and its relationship to memory.  \n\nWe will conclude this first phase of the course by reading a critique of Barthes's discourse by Lydie Modelino with understanding that mythologizing and ideological discourses cannot necessarily be excluded from politically, culturally and intellectually thoughtful critical projects. This will allow us to then take account of our practices and become critical analysts of how we read the world. Students will practice their own acts of reading and deciphering in order to put their theoretical knowledge to work and to decipher the world in which they circulate, for we often can see the ideological underpinning of others' activities than our own.  \n\nIn phase two of the course covering the last three weeks of the quarter, students will develop, research, and write a culminating research project beginning with the framework provided by our class readings and then expanding and deepening it by selecting their own topic for research and actually doing the work of research and investigation."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Seniors Majoring in French"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"To enhance students' critical approaches to reading and writing; to strengthen their ability to set ideas and texts in conversation with each other; to develop a methodology for reading literature, theory and history together; and finally, to be able to read, speak and write at advanced level in French about concepts, ideas and hypotheses."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Discussion, research project."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Response papers/postings: 20% \n\nPresentation of reading materials 10% \n\nResearch assignments 20% \n\nPresentation of final project: 10% \n\nFinal research project: 30% \n\nParticipation and attendance 10%"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"-Etienne Achille & Lydie Moudileno Mythologies postcoloniales, Paris: Honor?

For the cinema, the emblematic medium of the twentieth century, turned the powers specific to it (e.g., montage, projection photography) to articulating or developing aesthetic, philosophical and political problems posed by literature, philosophy and painting in the previous century. This invites us to think the relationship between centuries in two ways. First, problems posed in the 19th-century continue to shape (and limit the possibilities of) the forms in which twentieth-century art mobilizes its powers. For, having outlived the situation in which they were initially formulated, these problems continue (in Marx's phrase) to \"weigh like a nightmare on the brains of the living\".

Central questions of the course include: How do categories of \"Othering\" determine disease and health in individuals and collectives? How is medical science and care influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient trust? How do social and economic inclusion/exclusion control access to health treatment and self-care and care of others?

Soils are strongly influenced by climate and parent material and they vary in their ability to store water and nutrients. Processes of plant growth and decay respond directly to climate and soil productivity which leads to biomass production. All of the biogeographic processes are then used to derive expected patterns of natural vegetation around the world. Local-scale variations are brought in as modifications of the global model.

Together we will examine selections from these histories with an eye towards how they make use of new archives, reading strategies and research methods to offer a more nuanced account of second-wave feminism and practice using these research strategies through in-class assignments with (pre-selected) archival materials. As historian Finn Enke points out \"1970s feminism has entered collective memory as an exclusionary thing, distinct from the experiences, labor, and critiques by feminists of color, trans and queer people of the same era\" but challenges us to reconsider \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past,\" or risk missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today.\" Much recent scholarship on this period has taken up Enke's challenge including histories that document the anti-imperialist and coalitional politics of the \"gay and lesbian left\" (Lavender and Red, 2016), explore \"the long history of transfeminist activism\" (TSQ Special Issue: Trans/Feminisms, 2016), recuperate the critical contributions of Black feminist organizations in \"broadening the scope of the women's movement\" (Living for the Revolution: Black Feminist Organizations, 1968-1980, 2005), and chronicle \"activism by, for, and about incarcerated domestic violence survivors, criminalized rape resisters, and dissident women prisoners in 1970s and early 1980s\" (All Our Trials: Prisons, Policing and the Feminist Fight to End Violence, 2018).

Before the homo/hetero divide, before what Michel Foucault calls as \"the implantation of the perverse,\" before genders in their modern forms, what were the routes, locations, effects, and politics of sex and desire? To what extent can we discuss \"sexuality\" in relation to \"identity\" in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England.

From the 19th century to the present, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How have these associations changed over time? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary \"wellness culture\"? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men?

A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history. Students in this course will learn, first, about Hamilton's life and times. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a \"bastard brat\" who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past?

Relying on a 'History from Below' approach, we will analyse shared identities and joint experiences, and discuss a wide range of daily encounters and collaborations which took place between ordinary Jews and Arabs in different spheres such as: mixed cities, education system, business and labor market, political organizations, leisure spaces and more. Using historical primary sources, we will examine the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"*To increase the understanding of the complex and multifaceted relationship between the Jewish and Arab communities. \n*To shape an informed historical opinion upon a contested historical period and encourage critical thinking in relations to it. \n*To familiarize with recent scholarly developments, methods, and approaches in the historiography of Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine/The Land of Israel. \n*To encourage active participation in class discussions and in critical evaluation of primary and secondary sources."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"30% Class participation , 30% mid-term essay, 40% final paper"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"TBA"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"History Area(s) of Concentration: Africa/Middle East"}]}],"002030":[{"unique_id":"26464","instructors":["David   Shyovitz"],"mode":null,"title":"Europe in the Medieval and Early Modern World","subject":"HISTORY","number":"201-1","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWeFr","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"11:50","room":{"building_name":"Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course surveys the history of Europe from the High Middle Ages through the early modern period to the Age of Atlantic Revolutions.

Political and religious freedoms emerged alongside new forms of persecution, control, and oppression. A divided Europe grew increasingly connected to the rest of the world as commercial goods, people, ideas, and diseases traveled across land and sea. Among the major themes we'll explore are a) how individuals who lived through these tumultuous centuries experienced their changing world and b) how changes in health, disease, and environment - including the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, and the climactic cooling period known as the Little Ice Age - drove the religious, political, social, and economic upheavals of the late medieval and early modern periods."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Participation, Exams, Short Writing Assignments"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"TBA"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"History Area of Concentration: European"}]}],"017373":[{"unique_id":"28882","instructors":["Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern"],"mode":null,"title":"Jewish History 1789-1948","subject":"HISTORY","number":"203-3","section":"20","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"15:20","room":{"building_name":"Parkes Hall 224"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Modernity has dramatically changed the profile of Western Civilization and had a major impact on the European Jews.

Yet as most scientists today will freely admit, decisions about which research questions earn attention (and funding) and how research is carried out are influenced by powerful institutions, political considerations, business interests, technological changes, imperialism, and societal expectations. Science is, after all, a human activity. With this lesson in mind, our course surveys the history of science from the Enlightenment until the Cold War, in a series of units examining medicine, physics, biology, and earth sciences.

After countless protests to demand government action and answers, their story came in the form of a graphic novel. Journalist Andalusia K. Soloff spent years with these families investigating the 43 disappeared students and eventually published Vivos se los Llevaron (Taken Alive) to recount their fight for justice. When the story returned to its regional authors, it was accessible to some of the parents of the 43, illiterate community members, and even aired over local airways in Amuzgo for native speakers. \n\nIn this course we explore how historians and journalists like Andalusia use graphic novels to tell complex, sensitive, and silenced stories. Together we learn and argue that when and where a story starts and who starts it can shape how it's told, why it's told, and what impact it can have. Historical graphic novels have long helped authors communicate crises to broader audiences, but what lessons do they teach us about historical and journalistic research questions and methods? What do graphic novels show us about conflict, justice, and discourse? How are graphic novels expanding history and journalism to make space for new politics of storytelling? How do graphic novels that center women, the environment, or people of color fundamentally change stories?\n\nThrough reading graphic novels written principally by women and people of color, such as Wake (2021) and Crossroads (2021), students will investigate the historical patterns of three themes--environmental justice, human rights, and gender-based violence--and then write a series of short writing assignments and one final paper.

It will do so through reading classic and emerging scholarship on the place of state power in creating and maintaining public order through policies of inclusion, exclusion, hierarchy, connection, and conflict. After considering the changing dimensions of state power and organization, it will explore the role of the state as actor in organizing and mediating social categories and ask why social politics often includes efforts to remake or capture the state, thus fostering more capacious and complex understandings of what politics is and how it works. While course readings will focus on the history of the United States, its questions, concepts, and insights should be of value in other geographical and temporal contexts."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"To read carefully and critically; to think, speak, and write creatively and constructively about history and historiography; to learn important developments and concepts in the history of the United States"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Seminar discussion, including introducing assigned readings; book reviews; historiographical essays"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"tba"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"History Area(s) of Concentration: Americas"}]},{"unique_id":"28880","instructors":["Haydon Leslie Cherry"],"mode":null,"title":"Topics in History","subject":"HISTORY","number":"492-0","section":"24","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"11:50","room":{"building_name":"Harris Hall L40"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Topic: Southeast Asia: History & Historiography\n\nThis seminar is an introduction to the most important figures, works, and debates in the history of modern Southeast Asia.

And how might we foster meaningful dialogue across the disciplines and among individuals?

Did the first complex territorial states we call empires emerge and develop in similar ways? What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent studies compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze aspects of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras. \n\nThis course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East. We will examine different aspects of territorial expansion, consolidation, and rule, including state ideology, bureaucracy, cosmopolitanism, urbanism, borders and frontiers, religion, and the creation and circulation of the imperial image.

The division into two territories -one Hindu-majority, the other Muslim-majority - was accompanied by perhaps the largest migration in human history. Millions moved from one territory to the other, often against their will, as hundreds of thousands were killed in the ensuing chaos. The unprecedented violence of Partition - physical, emotional, social - profoundly shaped the national identities of India and Pakistan, permanently restructured the texture of everyday life and altered the global political order. From the subsequent partitioning of Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1971, to enduring border disputes in Kashmir, from ongoing cross-border migration to unresolved conflicts over identity and belonging, Partition continue to shape the region today. Partition's legacy today extends far beyond the heavily-fortified frontier and into the art, literature and popular culture of the three countries that emerged from it. Even as the post-colonial states treated Partition as an aberration best forgotten - a footnote of a midnight tryst with destiny - the arts emerged as the primary space in which the meaning of Partition was negotiated and mediated. What could not easily be engaged directly found its expression, often allegorically, on the silver screen or the off-white pages of literary magazines. This class will examine how Partition has been engaged in literature and popular culture, moving from contemporary depictions from the 1940s to its continued invocation in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today. We will read/watch these texts alongside the extensive body of scholarship on Partition from History, Anthropology and Gender Studies with particular attention to the historiography of Partition and South Asian nationalisms. Throughout, we will engage with the idea of Partition as an \"event\" and ask how Partition continues to inflect life in South Asia and beyond today."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"- Gain a familiarity with Partition as a historical event and literary efforts to give meaning to it - Develop an understanding of how trauma is negotiated and signified through literature - Examine the role of literature and the arts in the development of national and sub-national discourses."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Essays and projects."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"None."}]},{"unique_id":"26640","instructors":["Debra K Tolchinsky"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics in the Humanities","subject":"HUM","number":"370-6","section":"22","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"12:30","end_time":"13:50","room":{"building_name":"Annie May Swift Hall 109"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"The Crime Centered Documentary\n\nIn this course, we will view non-fiction and hybrid films that revolve around crime, criminal justice, and criminal court cases.

Today we take science writing as an objective, transparent transcription of experimental data.  However, during the Scientific Revolution in Europe and Britain, literary form was vital to the transmission and popularization of new experimental methods. Indeed, literary representation was necessary to help people conceive new sensory worlds at microscopic, sub-microscopic, or planetary scale. We will explore the centrality of literary representation to pivotal new technologies in the early modern emergence of experimental science:  the microscope, the air-pump, the telescope, and the distillation apparatus. These technologies did not only challenge fervently held convictions about the natural world endorsed by the Bible, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, among other authorities. They also demanded new representational modes able to communicate concepts and vivify experiences inassimilable to old ways of understanding.  How can the pervasive agency of atmospheric pressure be figured in language? What words make the magnified body of a flea familiar, even beautiful?  Why poeticize the chemical reactions involved in refining a new global commodity, sugar?  What political viewpoints accompany Copernican visions of possible planetary worlds?  \n\nWe will explore how literary technology was as integral to the New Science as experimental technology.  Throughout, we will approach western science not as universal knowledge but as highly situated practice, whose multifarious economic, extractive, and imperial investments are woven into the fabric of its literary representation. We will dedicate significant time to satires of the new science, whose critical counter-representations of the frivolity, futility, or cruelty of experimental method illuminate the deep and ongoing stakes of science's relation to literature. \n\nThe class will be broken into interconnected units organized around the air-pump, microscope, distillation apparatus, and telescope.

For the past 50 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Vietnam War traces an arc that reaches from Soviet nuclear arsenals to Islamic suicide bombers, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to hopes for a wave of democracy in the Middle East. And now the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, a newly activist Russia and the presidency of Donald Trump. This course uses an engaging set of examples and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means, in an array of case studies.

Why has it emerged as a scholarly term and field over the past two decades and become especially dominant in the past five to ten years?

This course will aim to provide answers to these questions initially guided by Cedric J. Robinson's idea of the \"Black Radical Tradition\" (1983) and Paul Gilroy's idea of the \"Black Atlantic\" (1993). How do these texts, if at all, inform the scholarly usage of Black internationalism that comes afterward, namely and perhaps initially in Brent Hayes Edwards' The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism (2003)? How should we account for the persistence of Marxism and the Haitian Revolution within the field of Black internationalism? What about the field's turn toward Black women's historical theorizations of gender and sexuality, and most recently the Black nationalism of Garveyism? Moreover, what does it mean to view these political and cultural histories through a Black internationalist lens? All of these aforementioned questions will form one of two bases to the course; the second is research practices. Given Black internationalism is indebted to scholars in multiple fields?Black Studies, History, Political Theory, Cultural Studies, English Literature, and more?students will become versed in several disciplinary research and writing practices as a means of aiding their own independent research. Considering my own background in History and Black Studies, we will pay particular attention to the relationship between history and Black critical theory. How do scholars produce research that crosses both of these strands? What is \"the archive\" broadly conceived? How does archival work relate to the production of theory and vice versa? Moreover, how do we pursue an empirical and/or theoretical project that is (Black) internationalist in design and execution?"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"1.

Our discussions of these issues will focus on culture, gender, medicine, race, borders, activism, and (de)colonization. We will also discuss qualitative research methods, with special attention given to online/virtual research methods in an era of restricted international travel. Students will develop a refined research question and explore which methods are best suited to answering this question. Students will complete a polished 13-15 page research paper, with the following assignments spaced throughout the course to develop the paper: a research proposal, rough draft, peer review exercise, and final presentation.

Particular attention will be devoted to questions of gender and race, as the memory of Italy's racial laws and colonial past in Africa was about to be dimmed by the cultural politics of postwar recovery and, later, the economic miracle. Mindful of this process of historical erasure, we will then turn to the remarkable production of the 1960s and 1970s and analyze they way in which different directors (Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, Rosi, Pasolini) treated the problems of modernity and industrialization, migration, organized crime, and the media industry. Finally, we will assess the return of a documentary approach to reality in films like Garrone's Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008) and Rosi's Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2016) in the context of the current socio-economic crisis and the resurgence of populism and right-wing politics.

Our point of departure is Italy's current predicament, which sees the resurgence of right-wing politics and a widespread homophobic and racist stand. Several anti-immigration policies and the recent rejection of the Zan bill (which was meant to make violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime) urge us, yet again, to contest still enduring images of Italy as the land of love and of Italians as basically \"brava gente\" (\"decent people\"). We will begin by considering the ways in which mass media have contributed to construing gender and race stereotypes at different junctures in Italian history, keeping in mind the longstanding repression of Italy's colonial past in Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. However, the bulk of the course will be devoted to those practices of cultural resistance that developed within commercial film/television production as well as in more lateral or experimental contexts. Among the examples we will consider are Pier Paolo Pasolini's queer documentary, Comizi d'amore (Love Meeetings, 1964); Cecilia Mangini's Essere Donne (Being Women, 1965), a feminist take on Italian Marxism and anthropology; Adriana Monti's?Scuola senza fine (School without End, 1983), produced in the context of the experimental \"150 hours\" course; Gianikian and Ricci-Lucchi Dal Polo all'Equatore (From the Pole to the Equator, 1985), which re-edits archival footage of colonial travel and sport from the Fascist period; and contemporary works by Afro-Italian writers and artists such as Gabriella Ghermandi, Dagmawi Yimer, and Karima 2G.

Yet, the war is not remembered by shared facts - or even similar terminology - one side calls it a ?War of Independence' and the other ?the Naqba' [The Catastrophe.] How can historians understand both the history and memory of these events between 1948 and 1949 that continue to have such resonance in the present? This course will first examine how these two national communities living in the same space between the river and the sea came into increasing conflict from the late 19th century. We will examine the rise of Zionism, as well as Palestinian nationalism, first under Ottoman, then British rule. The class underscores the role of both individuals and institutions in the building of two proto-nations and their respective positions on the eve of war in 1948 - examining how this shaped outcomes both during and after the battle. The course will interrogate the 1948 war itself though an inter-disciplinary lens, using both primary and secondary sources drawn from scholarly texts as well as memoir, literature, photography, film, the arts, and other forms of digital history to shed light on these dramatic events from multiple perspectives. Lastly, moving beyond 1948, we will ask how much the past can be left behind as part of a peace agreement of the future."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"The history and memory of the 1948 war is a highly controversial and contested narrative both within and outside the State of Israel itself.

Students will also have an opportunity to develop their own arguments and frameworks in class discussion and course assignments.

We intend to focus on the ethnic components of these texts as evidence of cultural assimilation, dissimilation, or performance on the part of the authors who produced them in the U.S. The seminar looks at identity as a contextually-based fluid category, the result of spaces of negotiation. We will compare the representation of Eastern European Jewish experiences in the early twentieth century literature of immigrant authors from the Russian Empire and Romania to the representation of the same early twentieth century experience by contemporary (Jewish) American authors. We will assess how significant moments in the life of early twentieth century Eastern European Jews in America (such as the fusgeyer / marching emigration movement from 1900 Romania, the 1903 Kishinev pogrom from the Russian Empire, the original \"Bintel Brief/Bundle of Letters\" column in The Yiddish Daily Forward or the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York) were represented in early twentieth century literary works and how they are represented in contemporary, twenty-first century literary works. In this sense, we will consider the input of the gender lens and various literary genres (play, reportage poem, graphic narrative, travelogue, photo-word novel) looking back on the early twentieth century. We will analyze literary works by Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from the Pale of Settlement and Romania at the turn of the twentieth century (Abraham Cahan, Mary Antin, Anzia Yezierska, M.E. Ravage) and literary works rewriting the early 1900s immigrant experience due to contemporary (Jewish) American authors (Liana Finck, Margot Singer, Leela Corman, Jill Culiner, Barbara Kahn, Aleksandar Hemon, Robert Fink, Julia Alekseyeva).

A hip hop infused musical, Hamilton is widely considered to have revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical, just as many saw the American Revolution as a first for the world. There is also a resurgence of interest in Hamilton and Lin-Manuel Miranda, because of the Hamilton movie, put out by Disney+ a year ago, Miranda's recent production of his first musical, In the Heights; and the reopening of Hamilton on Broadway. We'll discuss of these things, in addition to Hamilton's evolving meaning and reception in 2015, when the musical first appeared, and 2021, a very different political and cultural moment in U.S. history. Students in this course will learn, first, about Hamilton's life and times. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born British subject who became an American revolutionary, a \"bastard brat\" who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. In studying his life and politics, we will also explore early American notions of honor and masculinity, marriage and infidelity, freedom and slavery. As we study Hamilton the man, we will also study Hamilton the musical, attempting to account for its extraordinary contemporary resonance. Why has this past person's continued to inspire such interest today, in a nation that looks so different from the one that Hamilton (and his enemies) knew? Where does the musical diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past?

The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law's role in social change; and law's capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions and organizational structures.\n\nCross-listed with Sociology 206-0"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Invitation to Law and Society: An Introduction to the Study of Real Law (Second Edition) by Kitty Calavita, ISBN: 9780226296616\nTo be confirmed..."}]}],"020991":[{"unique_id":"28416","instructors":["Robert L Nelson"],"mode":null,"title":"Sociology of Law","subject":"LEGAL_ST","number":"308-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"12:20","room":{"building_name":"Technological Institute M164"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course examines the relationship between law and the distribution of power in society, with a particular emphasis on law and social change in the United States.

A great number of studies have been devoted to understand the nature of syntactic operations and they have been crucially looking at the interaction of these operations with the locality constraints. However, in this direction of research, the nature of islands has been relatively disregarded for a long time. Although Ross's studies have revealed which domains are islands and which are not, the question why islands are islands and non-islands are not islands has remained unanswered except for a few studies (Chomsky 1986, Lasnik & Saito 1992, Rizzi 1991 and others). Even these attempts are facing serious challenges once we start looking at wide varieties of cross-linguistic data. The aim of this course is to learn the basics of transformational generative grammar by looking at locality constraints. In particular we are concerned with questions of what the nature of island constraints is, and what our current understanding of them is."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"No textbook.

What factors or institutions were crucial to their trajectory and success, and what theories have been proposed to account for them? What are the benefits and challenges of a comparative, multidisciplinary perspective, and what new kinds of histories might it produce? Many recent investigations compare Rome and Qin/Han China; others consider the historical sequence of empires in the Middle East, such as the Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid Persian empires; still others analyze characteristics of imperial formation and rule in historically unrelated empires in different geographical regions and eras. \n\nThis course examines selected case studies drawn from a wide geographical and chronological range, with special focus on the ancient Mediterranean and Middle East.

In that work, Hume argues that the object of morality are mental qualities that are useful or agreeable to ourselves or others.

How should we think about humor that denigrates a person or group of people?"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"In this class I will expect students (1) to learn the virtues and drawbacks of the leading theories of humor, (2) to be able defend their own views on the nature of humor in speech (class participation) and in writing (course papers)."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Lecture"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"There will be two term papers that are required over the course of the term, both of 5-7 pages (double-spaced).

The key to Heidegger's paradigm shift is the generalization of hermeneutics from a method of textual interpretation to a way of understanding human identity. The hermeneutic paradigm offers a radically different understanding of what is distinctive about human beings: to be human is not primarily to be a rational animal, but first and foremost to be a self-interpreting animal. In order to assess the explanatory power of hermeneutic philosophy and its limits, our seminar will undertake three tasks. First, we will analyze Being and Time's hermeneutic conception of human identity and its main philosophical consequences. To get a sense of the full explanatory potential of Heidegger's hermeneutics we will then analyze Gadamer's dialogical model of interpretation as elaborated in his Truth and Method as well as contemporary accounts that engage with the hermeneutic approach, like those of Miranda Fricker, Ronald Dworkin, Danielle Allen, and Robert Brandom. Third, we will explore the potential limits of the hermeneutic paradigm through an analysis of challenging approaches such as ideology critique and critical race theory, and the possibilities of articulating a critical hermeneutics along the lines of Habermas's ?democratic turn' in critical theory."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"The goals of the seminar are (1) to analyze the philosophical paradigm of hermeneutics that Heidegger articulates in Being and Time and Gadamer develops in Truth and Method, (2) to explore its potential limits through an analysis of alternative approaches such as ideology critique and critical race theory, and (3) to enhance the student's critical thinking, oral debate, and writing skills."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"presentations, class participation, and final paper"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"- Books:\n\nHeidegger, M., Being and Time, New York: Harper & Row, reprinted 2008.

We will be concerned to understand and investigate Kant's defense of teleological explanation in biology - organic nature should be understood as organized purposively, parts or aspects of beings as directed towards ends - as well as his various claims concerning the nature of human history. For example: does history have a purpose, and if so, which, and how could we know of it?  What kind of description, knowledge, understanding is appropriate to history as an object (are there laws of history, for example)?  We will also investigate the relationship among these doctrines: given Kant's use of biological terminology in his history writings, on his view is historical investigation strongly akin to biological explanation, or based upon biological premises?  Or does human freedom or rationality disrupt biology, rendering history distinct from nature? All of these doctrines intersect with Kant's well-known racism: he develops his biological theory of race while working on his philosophy of biology, and his racist claims in that context are connected to historical views concerning human cultural and moral development.

Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national.

The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, indigenous studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity as we explore strategies to think religion anew in the contemporary world.

Efforts to reduce emissions are well-intentioned attempts to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, but have yet to spur the magnitude of action required. In this course we will explore the intersections of climate science, traditional ecological knowledge, and climate justice to unpack how different knowledge systems inform and impact effective climate governance and policy. Often unrecognized in science and policy arenas, traditional ecological knowledge generates insights for strengthening efforts to effectively address climate change. In this course, we ask: to what extent and how do different knowledge systems gain and lose traction in different climate policy arenas? How, why, and with what effects are the science and policy of climate change far removed from the people most vulnerable to its impacts? Is the exclusivity of science?marginalization of knowledge systems and extricating climate science from climate change experiences?the greatest threat to effective climate action? And, how might policy arenas facilitate the introduction, deliberation, and circulation of plural worldviews and knowledge systems?\n\n In this research seminar, students will directly engage with an ongoing collaborative research project that seeks to answer these questions. The seminar is structured to reflect the research process. Students enrolled in this course should consider themselves research apprentices and collaborators. There are three parts to this course: literature review, data analysis, and execution. In the first part of the course, we begin by first identifying and engaging with the empirical puzzles around science and knowledge in global climate governance to formulate a series of questions that emerge from these puzzles. We will engage the literature on global climate governance, climate policy, and knowledge politics, explore different research methods and approaches, including ethnography, content and discourse analysis, and quantitative interpretation of qualitative data. Each student will then conduct a mini-literature review on one of our broader questions and propose a research question, hypothesis (argument), and methodological strategy for carrying out the research. In the second part of the course, we will work to develop data collection and analysis skills. In the third part of the course, we complete the execution of the project, with each student developing and strengthening analytical writing skills by producing an original research paper."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Attendance at first class required"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDevelop empirical insights about the relationships between climate science, climate justice, and climate governance;\nDevise appropriate methodological approaches for analyzing diverse types of data;\nDesign, plan, and produce a problem-based empirical research paper;\nIntegrate collaborative approaches in learning, leadership, and problem-solving endeavors;\nSeek and cultivate meaningful modes of engagement to advance learning."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Seminar and field work"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"(1) Research project, including literature review, research design, data collection and analysis, final research paper (70%) \n(2) Participation and contributions to collective learning (30%)"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"(1) Smith, Linda Tuhiwai.

This course reviews key political and anthropological theories of membership in political societies since antiquity to address foundational questions about political membership, such as: why do all political societies use birth (jus sanguinis or jus soli) as the paradigmatic decision rule for membership? What are the implications of this decision rule for attachments of nationality, ethnicity, race, and religion? What are the similarities and differences among these groups, heuristically and politically? What is the intellectual history of \"the nation\" and the claims that it is modern? Is the nation an inherently toxic form of membership that produces unjustified exclusions at best and genocide at worst? Or is there a form of national belonging that cultivates empathy and mutual care among economically and otherwise unequal members, such that the nation may and should be preserved but should be isolated from its adverse effects? The course will review G.W.F Hegel's attack on social contract theories of belonging and war. We will conclude by reading queer and post-colonial criticisms and defenses of native or indigenous nations and communities. Authors we will read to engage questions about the uses and disadvantages of political societies using birthright for membership, with special attention to the implications of the nation for state violence, include: Plato, Aristotle, John Locke, Immanual Kant, G.W.F.

It is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview or broad survey of the general topic. Rather, it offers a curated look at a selection of important themes, topics, and questions. Are the sources and structures of inequality in the United States cross-nationally distinctive? In what ways does it make sense to say that broad patterns of social and political conflict over economic distribution have shifted historically in response to underlying transformations of the American economy? To the extent that the fruits of American prosperity were more equally distributed among white Americans after the Second World War, compared to any period before or since, what has led to the alarmingly high level of economic inequality and political polarization that is plainly evident in our time? Why has Black protest against racial inequality since the late-1960s (not coincidentally the moment in time when the federal government laid the policy foundations of mass incarceration) largely taken the form of urban rebellion? What do ordinary Americans today think about economic inequality, and why have American elites nevertheless been able to continue amassing ever greater amounts of power and wealth? Among the assigned readings are Piketty's Capital and Ideology, Levy's Ages of American Capitalism, Prasad's Land of Too Much, Hacker and Pierson's American Amnesia, Phillips-Fein's Fear City, Hinton's America on Fire, Kruse and Zelizer's Fault Lines, McCall's The Undeserving Rich, and Wessel's Only the Rich Can Play.

However, most people have great difficulty understanding infinite sets like these. Are there more positive integers than positive even integers? Are there more rational numbers than natural numbers? Are there more real numbers than rational numbers? You might be surprised at the correct answers to some of these questions. To set the stage, we'll look (informally) at some of the math background on infinity, as developed by Georg Cantor and others in the 19th Century. Then we'll examine some reasons why thinking and reasoning about infinity is so difficult.

We will begin at the very beginning of life and learn the biological and environmental influences that help to shape people's personalities over time.

We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology?

In this class we will consider the evidence both for and against the idea that language influences cognition. In so doing we will delineate different ways in which language might interact with cognition. We will read papers that compare semantic structures across languages, as well as empirical papers that test whether these semantic differences matter in nonlinguistic tasks, and whether these differences matter in children's cognitive development.

The emergence of the concept of \"religion\" as an object of comparison and study grew out of early modern European sectarian violence and colonial overseas expansion. We then turn to study some thinkers from the 19th and 20th centuries who developed theories about the best ways to study religion. These scholars developed and honed the fields of sociology, anthropology, and psychology by testing their methods on case studies about religion. To know this history is to know our present, as well as to understand the methodologies that shape the university curriculum. What do we do with this legacy? Are these methods adequate to understanding religion today? In the second half of this class, we critically evaluate these methods by putting them to work to analyze religion in the world, both past and present. We will focus on how religion moves people. People are rooted in space and place by their religious practices, while simultaneously being moved by religion. As will have become clear in the first half of the course, religion is a moving target because people themselves do not stay the same.

What does this event indicate about God's existence? In human terms, they asked: how do we live as Jews today? How do we live as human beings? Given that the Holocaust occurred in modern Europe and within the context of the Second World War, not only Jews but Christians and others asked many of these same questions and also struggled to articulate answers.

We study these dynamics comparatively, examining the ways in which religious, legal, and political traditions intersect, interact and co-constitute. A second objective is to connect these cases to local (Northwestern, Evanston, Chicago, Illinois, and US) communities and concerns, focusing on religion, race, and indigeneity.

Are the sources and structures of inequality in the United States cross-nationally distinctive? In what ways does it make sense to say that broad patterns of social and political conflict over economic distribution have shifted historically in response to underlying transformations of the American economy? To the extent that the fruits of American prosperity were more equally distributed among white Americans after the Second World War, compared to any period before or since, what has led to the alarmingly high level of economic inequality and political polarization that is plainly evident in our time? Why has Black protest against racial inequality since the late-1960s (not coincidentally the moment in time when the federal government laid the policy foundations of mass incarceration) largely taken the form of urban rebellion? What do ordinary Americans today think about economic inequality, and why have American elites nevertheless been able to continue amassing ever greater amounts of power and wealth?

How did the university reach its current manifestation and where does it go from here? Beginning with an overview of its origins in the German Enlightenment, the seminar will then shift to focus on the development of existing departments and programs at the end of the nineteenth century and the disciplinary knowledge which they house nowadays. We will be especially interested in the rise of the research university in the United States after 1945 and its decline some forty years later. We will seek to understand undergraduate liberal arts education and graduate education within the pedagogical and administrative frameworks in which they function. What is their relationship to job markets, and how do different institutions position their students in relation to those markets? We will also study the university's various members and constituencies, such as students, faculty, and administrators, and their roles. Within this context, we will explore challenges facing the modern research university, including the impact of neoliberal policies and mounting student debt, public vs. private institutions, the decline of academic freedom, the high cost of postsecondary education, the growth of contingent labor, the downsizing of tenure-track faculty, the corporatization of university administration, technical training vs. liberal arts curricula, and the introduction of consumer culture into the higher education, among others."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Class discussion"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Class participation, 2 personal essays, Journal, Group presentations."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Materials will be available in Canvas."}]}],"003143":[{"unique_id":"26715","instructors":["Rifka   Cook"],"mode":null,"title":"Accelerated Elementary Spanish","subject":"SPANISH","number":"115-1","section":"22","meeting_days":"MoWeFr","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"9:50","room":{"building_name":"Shepard Hall Classroom B05"},"start_date":"2022-01-03","end_date":"2022-03-12","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Spanish 115-1 is the first course in this two-quarter (Winter and Spring quarters), first-year language course in elementary Spanish designed for students with previous experience in Spanish.

While all this happened some four hundred years ago, reading and writing are still central to our everyday lives (case in point: you are reading this description to decide whether you will enroll in this class). In the spirit of Cervantes, we will study his famous text with a focus on the practices of reading and writing?how and why did people read and write in 17th-century Spain? How were different forms of writing connected to class, gender, race, and religion? What did literacy mean in the early modern world and what implications does this have for us today? We will employ different methods of reading (close, distant, collective, etc.) and different forms of writing (analytical, creative, etc.) to gain a better understanding of this key text.
