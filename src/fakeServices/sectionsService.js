Because these days they frequently and dutifully report stories that portray President Trump in an unfavorable light, or that report opposition to his policies. To him that's \"fake news,\" and the media are \"the enemy of the people,\" an utter derogation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. In this atmosphere other people, too, are sometimes savaging the media. So, it's unsurprising, but melancholy, that attacks on journalists are occasionally physical, and once horribly tragic: five journalists murdered in a small newsroom in Maryland. \n\nBut this opprobrium is an opportunity. Why? Because too few Americans, even before President Trump, fail to see that a vigorous, independent, free press, sanctioned and protected by our Constitution, is essential to democratic government. As the Washington Post proclaims, \"Democracy dies in darkness.\"  \n\nThere are ramifications in both the ethics and law of journalism. Indeed, the rule of law, so fundamental to American democracy, is itself impugned by President Trump. \n\nThis course gives us the opportunity to consider the essence of the news media, why and how print and internet publications and broadcasters exist, and the American legal system that provides exceptional protection but also limits freedom of the press.  \n\nWe don't simply memorize certain rules you must follow. Instead, we examine principles that, important as they are, allow leeway for interpretation in concrete circumstances. And sometimes there are contradictions between journalism ethics and judges' applications of the law. We'll explore them.  \n\nThis course will help guide you in making legal and ethical decisions, especially on the street in unexpected circumstances, but it's not intended to provide a rule for every conceivable situation. Sometimes you'll have time to consult an editor or even a company lawyer before deciding. But often, in the last analysis, especially on deadline, your judgments, your decisions, will be your own. \n\nIf you're pointing toward communications work apart from journalism, these same legal and ethical principles?and conundrums?are still relevant. So is the legal enforcement mechanism.

And what are current expectations about journalism's changing role in reinforcing those values - or hewing to traditional role of holding power to account?

In partnership with the Medill Local News Initiative and another potential partner organization, students will craft short video pieces about local news organizations (newspapers, TV, radio, digital or other) that are struggling, surviving or thriving against the odds in communities across the Midwest. This class is for any student looking for advanced video storytelling skills and is different from the Medill documentary course (meaning students in both branches of the video cohort can join in). In the weeks leading up to the Explores week, students will practice more sophisticated shooting and field production, and develop a \"style book\" for their stories so that we have a consistent production quality and look for all the individual stories. For inspiration, we will watch and learn from great video storytellers, emulating their work in our own series of video pieces. In the middle of the quarter, students will travel in pairs to locations within a day's drive and spend four days reporting and shooting on the ground.

Amid one of the most complicated and intriguing periods in modern U.S. political history, with both political parties adjusting to the new Democratic administration, the stakes are high, the personalities intense, the issues significant, and the outcome unknown. This seminar is designed for you to develop valuable skills in political journalism and to produce portfolio-worthy coverage from a pivotal state, Iowa, where Republicans did very well in November. We will spend the quarter focusing on issues and people in the small towns of rural western Iowa, where voters feel poorly understood - even neglected - by the national press corps and the political elites. We will be working with respected Iowa newspaper editors to identify issues that are important to voters, from education, climate, rural health care, and immigration, to farm policy, COVID and the opioid epidemic. You will have the freedom to focus on issues that matter to you, and to prospective audiences, in whatever medium you prefer. Along the way, we'll study policies, personalities, political messaging, and truth-telling, going well beyond the horse race coverage that too often substitutes for meaningful and thoughtful work that matters to voters and the republic. For your final project, expect to choose an issue that matters to you and go deep, drawing on your Iowa reporting. Spanish speakers will have opportunities to report and, if interested, write in Spanish. Analyses, questions and random notions that challenge the conventional wisdom are encouraged. The class is taught by Peter Slevin, a longtime Washington Post political reporter, who is a contributing writer for The New Yorker."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Department consent required"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"None"}]}],"019377":[{"unique_id":"39020","instructor":{"name":"Mary Ellen   Shearer"},"mode":"Hybrid","title":"Politics, Policy, and Foreign Affairs Reporting Project","subject":"JOUR","number":"422-2","section":"21","meeting_days":"TuWeThFr","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"17:50","room":{"building_name":"Washington, DC Bureau"},"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LAB","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Students will delve deep into a particular politics and foreign affairs issue through an intensive multimedia reporting project on the subject.

It was someone else's job - say, the marketing or circulation department - to figure out how to reach and build the audience for the journalists' work. No more - we now need journalists to work in the emerging field of \"audience development.\" That's the focus of our class: learning how to build an engaged audience to support and strengthen a sustainable business model. You will learn how digital publications reach and engage audiences, how web audience measurement systems work and which measurements are most useful to publishers.  You will also gain practical experience using Web analytics by serving as audience consultants for a real digital publication.  Students will gain a deeper understanding of the art and science of audience development, the ways publishers envision and measure their audiences, and the factors that contribute to building a successful media business.     \n\nIn this course, you will:   \n\nBuild your understanding of audience measurement and the behavior of digital audiences   \n\nRecognize which analytics are most useful for measuring engagement with online content   \n\nGain an understanding of different approaches for building audience engagement   \n\nBuild proficiency in digital audience analytics tools by using what you've learned to recommend better audience-engagement strategies for a real digital publication. \n\nLearn about how audience engagement contributes to the business models that support media"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Daniel Hindman's The Internet Trap.  $23 hardcover, $17 Kindle"}]},{"unique_id":"33238","instructor":{"name":"Arionne Alyssa Nettles"},"mode":"Hybrid","title":"Special Topics","subject":"JOUR","number":"490-0","section":"27","meeting_days":"Fr","start_time":"13:00","end_time":"15:50","room":{"building_name":"Meets in Non-General PurposeRm"},"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LAB","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Podcasting is changing the face ? and form ? of today's journalism.

Not only does foreign law matter to U.S. lawyers in international business or international arbitration, but it is important within national law (consider Chicago litigation involving a contract governed by French law or a Miami resident bequeathing real estate in Italy). Indeed, a comprehensive ABA survey reveals that after 7 years of practice, 44% of U.S. lawyers report work involving foreign law, a figure that reaches 66% for lawyers in large firms and 65% for those working as inside counsel. However, the \"handling\" of foreign law raises formidable challenges. Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a U.S. lawyer? How to optimize one's understanding of foreign law? Are there methods, techniques, or strategies that can overcome differences across laws, languages, and cultures ? that can give reliable access to foreign law's singularity? How best to proceed, and what can be achieved? Meanwhile, many claim that U.S. courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Note that this course, despite its focus, finds itself effectively ranging beyond the issue of foreign law.

Learning the history permits us to think more deeply about the fundamental building blocks of our own law:  what happens to law when it is written down, can we have too much law, have lawyers become too important, have we lost something vital by abandoning custom, how do legal change and societal change relate?  Following the theme of the conflict between law made by jurists and law derived from the community&#39s sense of justice, we will study the Roman law in its different historical forms, the law of the Catholic Church, feudal law, customary law, English common law, and early attempts at codification.  The course readings consist of historical narratives which include examples of legal texts from each era, ranging from statutes to commentaries to judicial decisions to litigation documents.

What is the relationship of particular practice settings to career satisfaction?  How do diverse lawyers fare in different practice settings?  What sorts of skills, beyond legal skills, benefit new graduates in their early careers?  And are there particular ethical challenges related to certain career choices?  These and other questions will be explored by students in the course, The Legal Profession:  Careers of Law Graduates, through regular readings and discussion, including discussions with law graduates about their careers, work and experiences.  Readings will draw from empirical scholarship on lawyers' careers and the legal profession.

The second-step is untangling our implicit beliefs around the adversity and then articulating how those beliefs made us feel and influenced our actions. Then, and only then, can we move forward towards identifying and acting on a set of solutions to move through or overcome the impact of the adversity. \n\n-Navigate Fearless Asking and Fearless Conversations (Fearless Asking 2.0, Fearless Conversations 1.0): Avoiding a difficult conversation is estimated to cost businesses $1,500 or the productivity equivalent to an 8 hour work day. Yet, despite the impact of these awkward discussions on leaders and the workforce, over 89% of us have not had any training at all on how to tackle difficult conversations at work according to a recent survey in the UK. We will put tough conversations in context, and practice the skills to make having them much, much easier.\n\n-Create Positive Habits & Establish Goals (Habit Formation and Goal Setting 2.0): According to Philosopher William Durant, \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\" In other words, what we do is who we are. How we achieve our goals and success in life is built upon the good habits we form and the bad habits we break. In this course, you will learn how to set goals that are achievable, measurable, and time-bound. In addition, you will learn how to successfully create the underlying habits that underpins those efforts. Furthermore, this class isn't about learning the theory, it's all about applying it. When you \"graduate\" this course in 11-weeks, you will have clarity around your goals and the foundation for a new set of positive habits to achieve them. \n\n-Master the Art of Stress-Free Productivity: Our productivity is directly proportional to our ability to zoom out and relax. Only when we clear our minds and organize our thoughts can we achieve our goals and unleash our full creative potential. We will work on the following core principles:\n?Understand the difference between doing and busyness and learn to be comfortable with what we are not doing\n?Learn how to manage time, tasks, and projects\n?Implement a trustworthy system to capture, clarify, and do all of the various tasks and projects in our lives - both at school and at home"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"There are two required books for this class, which can either be purchased or borrowed from the library. \n\nTHE RESILIENCE FACTOR by Karen Reivich and Andrew Shatte, Three Rivers Press (IBSN: 978-0767911917); approx. cost is $19.00\n\nATOMIC HABITS by James Cleary, Averly (ISBN: 978073511292)"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"The experience  of the Entrepreneurial Endurance and Mindset course will likely feel very different than any other course you have taken in college.

Rather than a chronology, the course will be organized around specific genres that arose or underwent significant developments in the 1970s, considering cultural, political, aesthetic, and technological factors. Although our inquiry is rooted in the 1970s, we will consume music from the decades that followed, as well.

Evaluation will be based on daily homework assignments, class participation, and a final analysis paper.

of class","desc":"Problems of diversity, equity, inclusion, and access often involve the distribution of resources.  For example, access to fresh food is often limited in some urban areas, as is access to health care.  Understanding and redressing these issues therefore often requires the use of maps and mapping technologies.  In this course, we will explore the use of spatial analysis to address problems and opportunities of diversity and inclusion.  Students will learn to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create maps to understand and analyze these issues, and to suggest solutions.  Gaining familiarity with GIS therefore will be one of the major outcomes of the course. A focus of the program will be researching and completing a final project that identifies, analyzes and proposes solutions to an issue of interest to student groups."}]}],"000671":[{"unique_id":"38818","instructor":{"name":"Emma K Adam"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Adolescent

What lessons from history do popular films and literature attempt to convey? And what unintended lessons do they carry? We will consider how movies and literature about the Holocaust intended for young people may affect their perceptions of atrocities today. And we will ask questions about the gaps and misconceptions that Holocaust film and fiction can leave in their wake. Our exploration will take a practical approach by asking: How can we use Holocaust feature films and works of Holocaust fiction as vehicles for public education? And how can we design effective learning experiences to support the public's engagement with such texts? Creative responses to core course texts will be used to assess student learning, and students will have the opportunity to develop an original project connected to the course themes."}]}],"000591":[{"unique_id":"32434","instructor":{"name":"Lawrence A Birnbaum"},"mode":null,"title":"Research

of class","desc":"Doing high quality policy analysis is important. But the impact of policy analysis is limited if it does\nnot find its way into the policymaking process or fails to take into account the complexity of policy\nimplementation. In this class, students will learn about the factors that influence policy making, what\nhappens to policy as it makes its way through the system and gets played out on the ground, and the\nrole of high quality policy analysis in both of these processes.\n\nThe course begins with policy making. We will investigate key policy processes such as problem\nframing, agenda setting, policy communities, and research in policymaking. The second half of the\ncourse will focus on policy implementation. We will consider how policy moves through the system\nand into front-line agencies that interface with the public and carry out policy provisions and\nprograms. We will investigate how the relations between levels of government, the proclivities of\nfront-line workers like teachers, social workers, or policeman, and organizational history and culture\ninfluences what policy actually looks like on the ground.\n\nStudents will also learn to write and present a policy brief.

Students are expected to prepare for (i.e., complete required readings and assignments) in order to participate actively in class discussions and activities.

The format is intended to help students develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. For most lectures, visual and audio materials including PowerPoint slides, video and audio recordings will be used to enhance classroom learning. The reading load for the course is commensurate with graduate training. The required course readings and activities are designed to complement and to supplement information presented in the course lectures. The course is designed to provide multiple formats for students to express their knowledge of the course content. Assignments, lectures, and course materials have been designed purposefully to link theoretical content from the course to clinical translation. The assignments for the course map directly onto the course learning objectives. While the intention of the course is to provide students with the theoretical foundation required for clinical practice in the areas of acquired neurocognitive and neurolinguistic impairments, students will demonstrate this knowledge in assignments and examinations based largely in clinically relevant tasks (e.g., case reports/summaries, mock clinical reports, designing therapy and assessment plans, designing and delivering individual and care partner education/training materials and plans, etc.).

The course takes a cross-media genre studies approach to examine Latinx representation across different yet related industrial and representational spheres. Each week we will focus on a different genre and examine it through the lens of one film, one television episode, or two songs, creating a close comparative study over the quarter. We will explore significant key themes and moments to understand the conditions of Latinx representation in each media genre. For example, we will investigate how race, age, and gender are depicted in Children's TV series, such as Elena Of Avalor (Disney 2016-2020) and Dora the Explorer (Nickelodeon, 2000-2019). We will also consider the close relationship between Latinx audiences and horror films. Together, we will examine the border representation and the war on drugs in border films, such as in Miss Bala (Catherine Hardwicke, 2019), and the representation of gangs and violence in Chicano film, as seen in Mi Familia (Gregory Nava, 1995).  We will consider the role of comedy, humor, and laughter in the representation of Latinidad on sitcoms and TV remakes of Latin American telenovelas, such as Ugly Betty (ABC 2006-2010) and Jane the Virgin (CW, 2014-2019). Collectively, we will view cumbia and reggaet?n music videos, playing particular attention to musical collaborations with both Latinx and non-Latinx artists. The course engages several key questions: Where do Latinx genres come from, and how do they evolve? What is the relationship between Latinidad, media genres, and the industry's popular audiences? What type of aesthetic and narrative forms of Latinidad is depicted in each media genre? By the end of the quarter, students will leave the course with a deeper understanding of how Latinx media genres operate within texts and industry, audience, and cultural practices."}]}],"004349":[{"unique_id":"35025","instructor":{"name":"Lakshmi   Padmanabhan"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"History of Film II","subject":"RTVF","number":"312-2","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"11:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course introduces students to the cultural history of international cinema from the 1950s to the contemporary moment.

What role does the media play in that crisis? Media production depends upon the expenditure of large amounts of energy and natural resources. Media devices contain toxic materials and take part in a culture of obsolescence that sends increasing amounts of \"high tech trash\" to the landfill. Media content has often developed in close connection to advertising, and so has taken part in the creation of an unsustainable consumer culture. Despite marketing rhetoric that characterizes digital technologies as weightless, virtual, and environmentally clean, we learn more every day about the energy, resource, and labor costs that undergird the Internet. At the same time, media communication can function to increase awareness about environmental issues, can substitute for other kinds of high-carbon activities like international travel, can foster communication between humans and animals, and can aid in the fight for environmental justice, as well as a host of other social and cultural benefits. How can we make sense of the complicated equation of environmental cost and benefit in media culture? \n\nThis course will explore intersections of media and environment, considering media about the environment, media in the environment, and media as environment. It will cover a variety of media forms and examine how they shape our perception of the environment and foster environmental action. We will consider topics such as theories of media ecology; definitions of the \"Anthropocene\" epoch; the materiality of media infrastructure; media's role in raising environmental consciousness and promoting environmental justice; advertising and consumer culture; wildlife documentary; ecocritical aesthetics; environmental history; indigenous media; representations of landscape and soundscape; and animals as media performers.

The source of this holistic approach to working is gravity-directed relaxation.  SDS explains how the human body is designed to work with not against gravity; how using gravity teaches us to fully embrace the reality of the body in all its visceral dimensions.  \n--By using gravity's cost-free and always-available support, we explore how to perform any stage action with relaxation, power, and, mostly, efficiency.  Efficiency = using the least amount of effort to complete a task.  Or, in short, efficiency = using less to achieve more.  \n--In SDS, we practice working efficiently by learning gravity-directed lying, sitting, standing, and vocal exercises that we then apply to our monologues and partnered scenes.  The exercises guide us to 1) exhale and let go of unneeded physical and emotional tensions; 2) ground the body by sensing where the force of gravity \"wants\" the bones of our body to go (down!); 3) fuse the movement of our eyes, hands, and voice into a single action that helps us do any stage action with energy and without strain.  \n--Why do we focus on partnering the eyes, hands, and voice?  Because these small but mighty articulators of physical and emotional energy are our chief means of expressing our innermost convictions -- in life as well as in performance. Playwright Sarah Ruhl coined a phrase that sums up how these five ever-present body parts support us doing the work of SDS:  \"smallness in the service of bigness.\n\""},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"2 books, approximately $20.00 when purchased online second-hand.

However, as survival rates increase, many patients are faced with off-target effects and complications of cancer treatment, including compromised reproductive function -ranging from destruction of gametes to the loss of pituitary and gonadal hormone production. It is in this setting that the discipline of Oncofertility emerged which blends the field of oncology with fertility. Oncofertility  researchers  are  working  to  provide  information  about  the  iatrogeniceffects  of  drugs  on reproductive  organs  and  to  develop  strategies  that  will  preserve  and  restore  reproductive  function. Advances  in  the  oncology  arena  are  being  paralleled  by  those  in  reproductive  medicine  and  science, which together are continuously improving and expanding the fertility preservation repertoire for men, women,  and  children.  This  lecture  and  case  studies-based  course  bridges  basic  science  and  clinical knowledge  to  expose  students  to  the  translational  advances  in  the  field  of  oncofertility  and  fertility preservation. Course topics include fertility preservation in different populations (adult women and men, pediatrics,  transgender  and  disorders  of  sex  development  (DSD)populations),  tissue/cell  processing methods  (gamete  and  gonad  harvesting, processing,  cryopreservation,  and  storage),  clinical  care (patient   navigation   conversations,   consults,   cancer   agent   risk   factors,   psychological   factors), fundamental  biology  techniques  (bioengineering  gonadal  bioprostheses,  spheroids,  microphysiologic platforms, follicle culture), and ethical issues in the field.

Here are two good ones: TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator (Links to an external site.) and TI-36X Scientific Calculator (Links to an external site.). \n\nEverything Else: In addition to old-school paper and pencils, you will also be using Canvas (more below), and Desmos and Geogebra (explained in the INTRODUCTION module). \n\nAdditional required readings and media are posted on Canvas, including timely news articles, academic research, and videos that you will review in order to complete some assignments and participate in discussion forums."}]}],"023490":[{"unique_id":"38733","instructor":{"name":"Santiago   Canez"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Sequences and Series","subject":"MATH","number":"226-CN","section":"66","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"18:15","end_time":"21:15","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-29","end_date":"2021-06-13","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course covers the following: sequences, series, and convergence tests; power series, Taylor Polynomials and error; complex numbers; second-order linear ordinary differential equations and power series solutions."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Prerequisite: MATH 220-B."}]}],"016723":[{"unique_id":"37424","instructor":{"name":"Shuyi   Weng"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Linear Algebra","subject":"MATH","number":"240-CN","section":"65","meeting_days":"We","start_time":"18:15","end_time":"21:15","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-29","end_date":"2021-06-13","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course covers elementary linear algebra: systems of linear equations, matrix algebra, subspaces, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and orthogonality.\n\nThe course will combine asynchronous content and a midterm, final exam, and some office hours held during the scheduled time."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Prerequisite: MATH 230 or equivalent."}]}],"017935":[{"unique_id":"38726","instructor":{"name":"Antonio C Auffinger"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Probability and Stochastic Processes","subject":"MATH","number":"310-A","section":"65","meeting_days":"We","start_time":"18:15","end_time":"21:15","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-29","end_date":"2021-06-13","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course is an introduction to basic concepts in probability: probability functions, combinatorics, conditional probability and independence, random variables, basic distributions, sums of random variables, law of large numbers and central limit theorem.

What are the implications of economic openness, and how does it affect international conflicts and domestic distribution of wealth? Can (or should) governments do anything concerning global and domestic inequalities? What are some of the challenges that developing countries face? What sorts of problems do international actors encounter when they try to cooperate with others? What is the role of international institutions, such as the World Trade Organization?

Within psychology, the study of identity is generally situated either in the social or developmental sub-discipline, although the two areas offer many points of overlap. While this course will be centered in a developmental perspective, we will draw on social psychological theory as well.\n\nAcross mainstream psychological research, identity is generally understood as within a person, rather than as constructed in interaction. This is reflected in the multiple stage theories of identity development, which tend to minimize the role of the environment, including norms, policies, and everyday interactions.

However, of the various populations, groups, communities, ethnicities, nationalities and identities western scholarship in the humanities and social sciences has deemed worthy of legitimate study, it remains the case that whiteness as it shapes and affects both white populations and non-white populations is routinely exempted from analysis.

What might account for these common findings?  In this course we explore two related ideas to gain insights into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these imbalances than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive to the environments that we inhabit.

The course moves progressively from research about the early colonial period and forward chronologically until the 20th century, with a final discussion of migrant trajectories to the US.

The death of the nation-state was announced elsewhere. Yet, in the epoch of offshored refugee processing centers and border walls, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? what is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing to reconceptualize border as equally the product of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements.

Political ecology seeks to unravel the political forces at work in environmental processes on a global scale. It is a powerful strategy for reinserting politics into apolitical or \"greenwashed\" discussions of ecology and the environment and unsettling common-sense understandings of \"the environment\" or \"nature\" as separate from the social and the cultural.

On an empirical level this may be because archaeological remains of houses are ubiquitous in the archaeological record. On a theoretical level this may be because studies of households lead us to focus on peopled pasts. Thus despite its short history, household archaeology has taken a leading role in epistemological shifts which place people and their practices and differences at the center of archaeological interpretations of the past, rather than subsuming these into the \"noise\" of passive and depersonalized depictions of social systems. Our studies of household archaeology across this course will lead us to consider the importance of studying everyday life in the past. A study of everyday life in the past can lead to a more democratic understanding of societies inclusive of the full range of people that inhabited past societies. Studies of households and everyday life are not without their detractors and these detractors are often quite hostile. Because households and daily life are often considered \"micro\" domains were people interact with one another, they are not considered suitable areas of studies to answer \"macro\" questions of politics and society. In this class we will explore how \"micro\" and \"macro\" intersect in the analysis households and daily life making these vibrant domains to understand how micro (self, interaction, experience) and macro (institutions, power relations, society) merge as they shape and are shaped by people and societies.

Who are the agents of Buddhist modernity, and how do they relate to forms of secularism, colonialism, and nationalism? What socio-political and intellectual forces are mobilizing innovation and rationalization of Buddhism on a global scale? Is modernism about homogenization?

Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms.

We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity.

To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management.  Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.  The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.  The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.  This course is an opportunity to innovate, collaborate, learn and apply a new set of skills and knowledge while impacting the community."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Students must apply to take this course.<br/> \nInformation about application deadlines for future quarters and how to apply as well as more information about campusCatalyst can be found at: campuscatalystnu.org"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"1.

Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person's abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place?\n\nIn this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender.

We begin our consideration of her work with The Days of Abandonment, which revises the trope of the abandoned woman in new and startling ways.  We will also discuss the cinematic adaptation.

Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who desires the ability to understand the popular press, critically analyze government policies, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter.\n\nSynchronous Components: Class material will be delivered primarily through synchronous Zoom meetings at the scheduled class times, though these meetings will be recorded and made available for students in distant time zones.

We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law. Throughout the course we will explore the general topic of regulation and industry cases, both current and historical.\n\nSynchronous Components: Class material will be delivered primarily through synchronous Zoom meetings at the scheduled class times, though these meetings will be recorded and made available for students in distant time zones. The weekly discussion section with the TA will be synchronous. Synchronous attendance is strongly encouraged whenever possible to increase understanding and engagement.

On top of this, the world is two decades into a century that many predicted would usher in the decline of nation-states and emergence of more transnational forms of identification and exchange, while we are instead witnessing a resurgent tide of nationalist movements across the globe. This class examines cosmopolitanism, as both an ideal of global consciousness and a description of global phenomena, and how it is thought of and written about in an age of nationalisms. Approaching the topic as pivotal to understanding modern debates about identity, culture, and world politics, we will interrogate the definitional slipperiness of cosmopolitanism, the affects and ethics associated with the term, and its frequently antithetical, but occasionally symbiotic relationship to the ideal of patriotism. We will do this by reading widely across critics and scholars of cosmopolitanism like Kwame Anthony Appiah and Martha Nussbaum, historical essays by George Eliot and Karl Marx, and speeches across the political spectrum by Theresa May, Josh Hawley, and Bernie Sanders, as well as by watching and analyzing films such as \"Arrival\" (2016) and television episodes of \"Sense8\" (2015-2018)."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"The primary goal of this course is to improve your writing and reading skills.

That is to say, good writing is a process that requires reflection and revision in order to develop skills of argumentation, organization, clarity, and style.

The first half of the course will emphasize recent case studies of literature adapted into popular movies, tracking how not just the plots and characters but the perspectives, voices, structures, prose styles, and associated politics of written work get preserved but also transformed on screen, in blatant and subtle ways. In the second half, we will reverse course to examine plays, essays, and other literary works inspired by the movies. We will also explore some classic texts of popular film journalism and scholarly film theory, treating these as two literary and intellectual canons in their own right. Cultivating techniques of close analysis?whether breaking down a film sequence, parsing a scholar's arguments, or negotiating between two versions of the \"same\" story?will be the paramount skill developed in the course, hopefully leading to deeper appreciations of several kinds of texts. Moreover, students will gain a valuable fluency in how to watch, dissect, and debate movies at a time when they still retain enormous cultural sway, both as entertainment vehicles and as venues for sustaining or contesting cultural and political narratives.\n\nLectures, discussion sections, and assignments will presume no prior coursework in film studies, but they will require quick, studious absorption of terms and concepts that might be new. Moreover, the course requires a willingness to put movies and other assigned materials under close analytical pressure, while hopefully retaining the joy of watching, reading, and evaluating them. The syllabus has been streamlined somewhat from previous offerings and skews more heavily (though not exclusively) toward contemporary material, but the expectations of your writing, thinking, and conversation remain high.

This course will explore their accounts of the \"creaturely kinds\" before and during the time in which a more modern science was being launched.

We will approach the question of \"creatures\" by examining texts that call on species difference or variety and that use cross-species comparisons to make sense of embodiment. We'll stress encounters and engagement across species, rather than trace the grounds for a \"human/animal divide.\" We'll explore the problem of how we have imagined an objective standard for \"the human,\" against which the endless variety of all other animated things might be made homogeneous and compressed together as a lesser order of life within a conception of \"the animal.\" One goal will be to think about the central place of animals in the history of what we call \"human\" knowledge. Another goal will be to understand the capacities of the now-obsolete term, \"creature,\" as a name for all living things -- the term enshrines biological variation as a sign of plenty and also makes clear how sympathy, collaboration, and identification routinely occur across the differences of species. At the broadest level, the seminar will challenge the notion that all human thought has always been or must inevitably be \"human-exceptionalist\" thought.

Both saw themselves as extending but also complicating the intellectual, aesthetic, and ideological parameters of prior formations like \"gay and lesbian studies\" or \"LGBT film.\" These new and spreading discourses stoked each other's productive advances. Scholars developed and illustrated new axioms through the medium of the movies, while filmmakers rooted their stories and images in changing notions of gender performativity, counter-historiography, and coalitional politics. Still, queer theory and queer cinema faced similar skepticisms: did their ornate language and conceptual novelty endow dissident sexualities with newfound political, cultural, and philosophical stature, or did they retreat too far from daily lives, mainstream tastes, and ongoing public emergencies? Did \"queer\" enable elastic identification and coalition among subjects with a wide range of sexual and gendered identities, or did the term reproduce the demographic and discursive hierarchies it claimed to deconstruct? Was the lack of fixed definitions, consensus ideals, or shared aesthetic practices a boon or a harm in sustaining a long-term movement of art, action, or thought? This class will explore some decisive shifts as critical theory and narrative film reclaimed \"queer\" as a boundary-breaking paradigm, in the pivotal era of Gender Trouble, Epistemology of the Closet, Tongues Untied, and Paris Is Burning, though we will also complicate the \"foundational\" or \"canonical\" status often applied to such texts.  We will recover scholarly and cinematic trends that laid indispensable groundwork for these queer turns and will also track the subsequent careers of \"queer\" in the ways we perform readings, perceive bodies, record histories, reimagine genders, form alliances, enter archives, and orient ourselves in space and time.  Diversities of race, class, and gender identity will constantly inflect our understandings of \"queer\" and even challenge the presumed primacy of sexuality as the key referent for that term.

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a \"global consciousness\" and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and technoscience to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as \"humanity\" and \"species\" are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament."}]},{"unique_id":"39400","instructor":{"name":"Zeynep   Oguz"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture","subject":"ENVR_POL","number":"390-0","section":"27","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"What kinds of tools would help us understand urgent global issues we are facing today, ranging from global pandemics and climate emergency, wildfires in California and Australia, hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Louisiana, occupational diseases in South Dakota and Toronto, or urban infrastructure crises in Mumbai and Senegal?

Political ecology seeks to unravel the political forces at work in environmental processes on a global scale. It is a powerful strategy for reinserting politics into apolitical or \"greenwashed\" discussions of ecology and the environment and unsettling common-sense understandings of \"the environment\" or \"nature\" as separate from the social and the cultural. It is also an essential tool to understand how disparate-seeming places, events, and living entities in the world are intimately linked to each other in often uneven ways.

This course introduces students to a diverse field of French-language intellectual production concerned with analyzing, contesting, and transforming colonial relations of power and knowledge. French-language authors have produced some of the most radical critiques of French and European imperial projects in the modern era while innovating and/or contributing substantially to related fields such as critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies, literary theory, discourse analysis, literature, and philosophy. Yet, their reception in the Anglophone academy has often been marked by decontextualized or selective readings. Our priority will be to foreground the specificity of the French-language decolonial tradition as a response to a particular brand of colonialism rooted in a universalizing, humanist project, as well as to the particular local manifestations and effects of this project. Ranging across four main sites of theoretical production, including revolutionary Haiti, the mid-20th-century French Caribbean/Parisian axis, and Sub-Saharan Africa, our readings will highlight the ways in which French-language thinkers from Jean-Jacques Dessalines to Achille Mbembe have forged a distinctly non-essentialist theoretical tradition by innovating within and against intellectual currents of Enlightenment universalism, existentialism, historical materialism, psychoanalysis, structuralism, and post-structuralism. At the same time, through critical analysis and secondary readings, we will evaluate the continued relevance of these thinkers' attempts to conceptualize issues of intellectual and psychic (dis)alienation, political sovereignty, cultural identity, artistic creation, and freedom for intellectual projects in the humanities and social sciences today.

What made the musical an instant national sensation when it premiered in the summer of 2015, on the cusp of Obama's final presidential term? And how has its social meaning changed since?\n?\nThese are the types of questions we'll ask in this course. As we encounter a variety of cultural forms?stage performance, music, literature, film, and more?we'll also tackle broader questions such as: Why do we conventionally associate certain artistic genres with certain social groups? How are these conventions maintained, manipulated, and/or challenged through practices of adaptation and appropriation? How can creative expression communicate different social meanings depending on the generic tropes it draws on, on who is producing it, on who is reading, listening to, or viewing it, on social context, on historical significance, and on a number of other variables?\n?\nThroughout the course, students will develop skills in cultural analysis, exploring theoretical frameworks via examples of popular adaptation that we discuss in seminar.

In the twentieth century, military strategy and technology blurred the boundaries between war zones and home fronts. Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death.

Numerous historians of the period have challenged us to reconsider this claim, which elides \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past\" and risks missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today\" (Enke 2018). In this course, we will begin by examining how the \"second wave\" of feminism is being framed in 2021 and explore which projects, groups, and concerns have come to define the \"second wave\" of feminism in the United States in our collective memory. We then turn to recent histories of the \"second wave\" that challenge us to reconsider what counts as \"feminist politics\" during this period. For example, histories that focus on the formation of broad-based coalitions across and between liberation movements around issues of economic justice, reproductive rights, and the right to \"self-defense\" against both state and interpersonal violence during this period, challenge us to expand our conception of feminist activism. In the process, they require us to incorporate the \"critical insights and knowledges\" of labor and welfare rights activists, sex workers and gay liberationists, Black, Chicana, Puerto Rican and Indigenous liberation movement members as central to the feminist politics of the period.

Both saw themselves as extending but also complicating the intellectual, aesthetic, and ideological parameters of prior formations like \"gay and lesbian studies\" or \"LGBT film.\" These new and spreading discourses stoked each other's productive advances. Scholars developed and illustrated new axioms through the medium of the movies, while filmmakers rooted their stories and images in changing notions of gender performativity, counter-historiography, and coalitional politics. Still, queer theory and queer cinema faced similar skepticisms: did their ornate language and conceptual novelty endow dissident sexualities with newfound political, cultural, and philosophical stature, or did they retreat too far from daily lives, mainstream tastes, and ongoing public emergencies? Did \"queer\" enable elastic identification and coalition among subjects with a wide range of sexual and gendered identities, or did the term reproduce the demographic and discursive hierarchies it claimed to deconstruct? Was the lack of fixed definitions, consensus ideals, or shared aesthetic practices a boon or a harm in sustaining a long-term movement of art, action, or thought? This class will explore some decisive shifts as critical theory and narrative film reclaimed \"queer\" as a boundary-breaking paradigm, in the pivotal era of Gender Trouble, Epistemology of the Closet, Tongues Untied, and Paris Is Burning. We will recover scholarly and cinematic trends that laid indispensable groundwork for these queer turns and will also track the subsequent careers of \"queer\" in the way we perform readings, perceive bodies, record histories, imagine psyches, form alliances, enter archives, and orient ourselves in space and time. Diversities of race, class, and gender identity will constantly inflect our understandings of \"queer\" and even challenge the presumed primacy of sexuality as the key referent for that term. Participants will develop skills of close-reading films as films and engage nimbly with the overarching claims but also the curious nuances, anomalies, and paradoxes in the scholarship we read.

In this course, we will disregard this view and focus instead on South Asia's mesmerizing, contentious cities.\n\nThe class's organization is thematic as well as chronological; but over the course of the quarter, we will move from the early nineteenth century to the twenty-first century. We will spend time with a variety of texts, including fiction, poetry, memoirs, blog posts, and films. Secondary works by scholars of literature and history will help us get below the surface and to consider a variety of ways to think about cities, art, and society. Approaching these texts as documents of ways of thinking and living, while remaining alert to their aesthetic qualities, will help us think about what makes modernity modern, what makes cities urban, and what makes a colony colonial.\n\nAt the same time as we consider the form and content of the texts, we will also address questions of translation. Translation is famously difficult, or maybe impossible, but at the same time it is not only necessary but can also offer us new ways to read. By critically approaching texts in the original and in translation, and by reading reflections on the practice of translation, we will seek to understand the dilemmas and insights that emerge from reading and writing translations.\n\nTwo overlapping courses are offered: ASIAN_LC 260 (meeting MW) is open to anyone and will be taught entirely in English, while HIND_URD 316 (meeting WF) is open to students with suitable proficiency in Hindi or Urdu.

Paradoxically, the iconic genocide of the modern age that silenced millions of the murdered, and destroyed all trace of many of them, has also bequeathed to posterity the largest number of first-person testimonies about any single historical event. In this course we will examine a range of firsthand accounts of the Holocaust from the period itself and the subsequent decades.  We will read selections from diaries, letters, memoirs, graphic novels, and courtroom testimony.  We will discuss accounts left behind by victims, perpetrators, and so-called bystanders.

The conflict wrought unprecedented destruction on the continent: entire cities were leveled and whole populations decimated. Tens of millions of Europeans perished, the majority of them civilians, but civilians were not only victims, they were also participants in a \"total war\" for which governments mobilized societies and organized economies to a degree never before seen. This course will examine the Second World War in Europe from its origins in Germany's expansionist aims, through the invasions of Western Europe and the Soviet Union, and on to the conflict's final crescendo in the defeat of Nazism and its denouement in postwar retribution and decolonization. For decades scholars and the general public approached the overall military conflict, individual national wartime histories, and the genocide of Jews and other minority groups as distinct stories that could be told separately.  One of the goals of this course is to understand how those developments and the people they touched (and destroyed) were integral and interrelated parts of a single narrative of the Second World War in Europe."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"The course aims to introduce students to the history of the Second World War in Europe from its origins to its aftermath.

People have framed questions about nature very differently in different contexts. Moreover, our dominant stories about the development of modern science do not adequately recognize contributions and perspectives from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. What does the history of modern science look like from the Global South? With these challenges in mind, we will tackle a wide range of subjects, including: prediction, ecology, medicine and pharmacy, the scientific revolution, ?indigeneity,' translation, elite and popular science, science fictional imaginaries, and Cold War development.

The student's chosen artifact may hail from any time or place, and exist at almost any scale of \"materialization\" so long as it can be framed as a research question: from the Atlas V rocket to Raggedy Ann dolls, and from police body cams to computer algorithms."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Research and writing an original historical paper"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Research paper (with building-block steps along the way)"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Readings on canvas, plus a few readily accessible books such as: Robin Bernstein, Racial Innocence.... and David Edgerton, The Shock of the Old"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"History Are(s) of Concentration: Americas"}]},{"unique_id":"36112","instructor":{"name":"Carl Forbes   Petry"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Research Seminar","subject":"HISTORY","number":"395-0","section":"24","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"39915","instructor":{"name":"Henry Claxton   Binford"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Research Seminar","subject":"HISTORY","number":"395-0","section":"26","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"002153":[{"unique_id":"36113","instructor":{"name":"Edward Wallace   Muir Jr"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Thesis Seminar","subject":"HISTORY","number":"398-3","section":"20","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"11:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"002155":[{"unique_id":"36151","instructor":{"name":"Tessie P Liu"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Seminar in Historical Analysis","subject":"HISTORY","number":"405-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"We","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"36152","instructor":{"name":"Lauren K Stokes"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Seminar in Historical Analysis","subject":"HISTORY","number":"405-0","section":"22","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"016119":[{"unique_id":"36197","instructor":{"name":"Geraldo L Cadava"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"General Field Seminar in American History","subject":"HISTORY","number":"410-3","section":"20","meeting_days":"Mo","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"020597":[{"unique_id":"39916","instructor":{"name":"David   Shyovitz"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Field Seminar in Medieval European History","subject":"HISTORY","number":"430-1","section":"20","meeting_days":"Fr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"12:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"002189":[{"unique_id":"39917","instructor":{"name":"David Lee   Schoenbrun"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Sources in African History","subject":"HISTORY","number":"465-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"002202":[{"unique_id":"31332","instructor":{"name":"Kenneth L Alder"},"mode":null,"title":"Independent Reading","subject":"HISTORY","number":"490-0","section":"01","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"IND","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"31333","instructor":{"name":"Michael J.

Over the past three decades, political ecology has emerged as a powerful interdisciplinary tool for understanding and critiquing global ecological change. Political ecology seeks to unravel the political forces at work in environmental processes on a global scale. It is a powerful strategy for reinserting politics into apolitical or \"greenwashed\" discussions of ecology and the environment and unsettling common-sense understandings of \"the environment\" or \"nature\" as separate from the social and the cultural. It is also an essential tool to understand how disparate-seeming places, events, and living entities in the world are intimately linked to each other in often uneven ways. In this course, we will critically approach topics such as resource extraction, conservation, carbon management, natural disasters, sanitation politics, and human-animal-plant relations.

Though modern abstract art is often assumed to be secular, since its inception in Europe in the early 1900s, many artists such as Hilma af Klint, Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Piet Mondrian explained their turn to abstraction in spiritual terms, indicating that modern art is uniquely capable of connecting us to hidden realities. The aim of this course is to learn to read the political, romantic, and aesthetic dimensions of modern art through a spiritual lens and provide students with critical tools to enhance the experience of seeing modernist films, paintings, or sculptures. The course will focus on the work of European and American artists as well as their contemporaries working in the global south. For example, Abanindranath Tagore created anti-colonial paintings that foregrounded India's \"spiritual soul\" in battle with the \"materialist\" British Empire. Other topics discussed include, Surrealism and magic, spiritual modernism as de-colonial practice, Sufism and Theosophy, American Abstract Expressionism, and Soviet spiritual cinema. We will examine key theoretical texts by Walter Benjamin, Clement Greenberg, and Rosalind Krauss."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"This class familiarizes you with major trends of modern art and their intersections with spiritual thought in the 20th century. Throughout the quarter, you will learn how to think comparatively and transnationally about the emergence of modern art, and the various ways modernist forms represented spirituality, or functioned as a substitute for religion in the secular world. Readings and discussion assignments are designed to help you strengthen your skills not only as careful viewers of modern art, but also as critical thinkers. The class helps you ask questions and compose reflections on art's spiritual and ideological role in modern societies. This means that you will learn the skills necessary to engage with artworks and artists that we will not study as well. [[You are encouraged to use the skills that you will learn throughout the class to develop your own interpretations, and to critically respond to how other critics have interpreted modern art.--delete?]] In addition, the class gives you grounding in modernist theory by focusing on a number of key theoretical texts. In response to the increasing speed of everyday life, we, in this class, will try practices of slow reading and critical reflection on art, text, and, by extension, life itself."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Lecture and Discussion."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Class participation and a final essay.

We will frame the course with essays by thinkers including Marianne Hirsch (\"The Generations of Postmemory\"); Alondra Nelson (The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations and Reconciliation After the Genome); Daniel Foor (Ancestral Medicine: Rituals for Personal and Family Healing) and adrienne maree brown (Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds) and Resmaa Menakem (My Grandmother's Hands: Racialized Trauma and the Path to Mending our Hearts and Bodies.) We will then read works of literature that cross genres and explore the author's ancestry with both research and imagination. These texts include \"No Name Woman\" by Maxine Hong Kingston, \"Kindred\" by Octavia Butler, \"The Pink Institution\" by Selah Saterstrom and poems by Seamus Heaney, Joy Harjo and Tarfia Faizullah. Most of the course will be spent in the dual symbiosis of close reading and creative writing. Students will be guided in how to write into the known and unknown chapters of their ancestry. They will develop a practice of imaginative, meditative writing. They will also learn to do focused research to connect their ancestral stories with historical and cultural contexts. Students will write creatively in response to their readings, and will end the course with a suite of poems, essays, or short stories that combine the personal with the historical, the self with the ancestors. (People unsure of their ancestry are certainly welcome in this course, and ancestry may be fluidly, openly defined.)"},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Discussion and workshop."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Papers and creative work, including a final portfolio."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Texts will include:\n\n    a free coursepack available on Canvas.\n    Kindred by Octavia E.

This class will explore storytelling across a range of methodologies that firmly situate narrative making within place and community, with a special emphasis on visual storytelling. Additionally, students will explore and situate their own crafted stories within the north Chicago community of Rogers Park, the most diverse neighborhood in Chicago. In the process, we will explore particular ethical and political concerns for media makers when collaborating, researching and working within actual existent communities. Class projects can take any storytelling form and will culminate in a group show staged for the Rogers Park community (either in-person or virtually given current pandemic conditions) for general audience reception and feedback. Alternately, students may also write final essays exploring a particular aspect of storytelling of place.

instrument of foreign policy. It will focus on the role of aid in five main periods of U.S. foreign policy: 1) the Marshall Plan and the struggle for Europe (1945-1961), 2) superpower competition in the developing world (1961-1989), 3) aiding the transition to democratic governance (1989-present), 4) countering violent religious extremism in the Islamic world (2001-present), and 5) meeting the challenge of globalization (present day). \n\nWe will look at how development aid emerged as a response to the superpower competition of the Cold War. The world's first major aid package, the Marshall Plan, was a key component in the U.S. strategy of containment: it was designed to prevent further Soviet encroachment into Central and Western Europe. With success of the Marshall Plan in Europe, Washington adopted foreign as a tool to contain the spread of Communism elsewhere, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the focus of development aid changed to reflect Washington's evolving strategic priorities. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe led to the danger of conflict and instability there, and presented the U.S. with the new challenge of aiding the newly independent states with their transition to democracy and the market economy. Congress responded with the Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) Act for Eastern Europe, and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) in the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe attack of September 11, 2001 awoke Washington to the danger of violent Islamic extremism. As in 1989, Congress responded to the need to counter this phenomenon with new aid packages. In this section of the course, we will focus primarily on efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, both during and after U.S. military action there.\n\nFinally, we will conclude by looking at how the challenges of globalization, particularly climate change and emerging health threats, are shaping today's foreign aid strategies. In the final week, students will present their ideas for future directions for foreign aid, in the form a briefing on their final project -- a set of recommendations on development policy for a hypothetical President."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Grades will be based on class participation, including an oral briefing on the student's final project in the last week (30%), a short midterm essay on the role of the Marshall Plan in the eruption of the Cold War (20%, 3-5 pages), and a final paper (50%), where the student will develop a \"Policy Memorandum\" on strategies for a hypothetical new President.

In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. \n\nThe course also will examine the security environment of the post-Cold War world, with a focus on Russia's efforts to assert what it sees as its right to a sphere of influence. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has proven deeply skeptical of Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.\n\nAs a final project, students will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Students will be required to write a midterm book review of one of the required books, and, as a final project, they will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"\t\nOne of the following:\n\nA World Transformed, by George Bush and Brent Scowcroft\nAt the Highest Levels, by Michael R.

(Taught in English)\n \nIn 2016, Time magazine included the Italian novelist who works under the pseudonym \"Elena Ferrante\" on its list of the year's hundred most influential people.  We will explore some of the most celebrated novels of this mysterious writer, who is beloved not only in Italy but also in the US and around the world.  Critics in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The London Review of Books, and numerous other publications have given ecstatic reviews to her writings, typically describing their effect as \"mesmerizing,\" \"stunning,\" and \"brutally honest.\"  Indeed, Ferrante's fearless, clich?-annihilating explorations of friendship, loneliness, troubling loves, sexuality, violence, and maternity suggest a creative and disruptive refashioning of traditional feminist concerns on an epic scale.  We begin our consideration of her work with The Days of Abandonment, which revises the trope of the abandoned woman in new and startling ways.  We will also discuss the cinematic adaptation. We will then read The Lost Daughter, the novelist's sophisticated and uncanny investigation of the agonized ambivalence of love and motherhood. Finally, the course concludes with My Brilliant Friend, the first volume of her bestselling series of Neapolitan novels.  In particular, we will focus on how this text redefines the contested territory of women's friendship. Throughout, we will address Ferrante's decision to keep her true identity secret, thus setting in motion the media's frenzy to unmask her."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Taught in English, seminar style"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Participation, 20%; Oral Presentations, 20%; 1 short paper (3 pages long), 30%; final paper (8 pages long), 30%."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"(Digital versions of the texts are acceptable) \nDays of Abandonment: ISBN: 978-1-933372-006\nThe Lost Daughter, ISBN: 978-1-933372-426\nMy Brilliant Friend, ISBN: 978-60945-078-6"},{"name":"Class Notes","desc":"Taught in English"}]}],"002339":[{"unique_id":"36965","instructor":{"name":"Noriko Taira   Yasohama"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Japanese I","subject":"JAPANESE","number":"111-3","section":"21","meeting_days":"MoTuWeThFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"10:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Japanese I (JAPANESE 111-1, 2 and 3) is a yearlong course that covers the first half of college level elementary Japanese.

We shall also focus on artistic and photographic depictions of the shtetl: Chagall and Roman Vishniac in particular.

This course takes the approach that the history of modern Israel is a dual narrative of two nations developing side-by-side in the same geographic space of Israel/Palestine, each seeking their own self-determination and social cohesion. Yet, as this course will emphasize, the history and historiography of modern Israel go far beyond the \"ripped from the headlines and history books\" accounts of decades of clashes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- we will examine the complex internal dynamics of each society-in-progress as well as the external processes that shaped both of their polities and their quest for peace. The syllabus has been organized in 8 week units as departures on the theme of \"aliya\" (lit. ascendance), a Zionist concept that has attached a positive and religiously-infused valance to Jewish national project and wave of immigrant-absorption prior to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. I have adapted this framework not only to cover both the pre- and post-state period in Israel/Palestine but also to put into focus many groups that were marginalized from this classic history of modern Israel. We will examine both continuity and change since 1948 when it came to the creation of the \"new Jew,\" successive waves of Jewish migration, Zionist settlement, and the \"Arab\" (or Palestinian) question. The goal of the course is gain a deeper appreciation of not only of the wars on the battlefield and between world leaders over the past century, but the major political, social, cultural, and religious trends that have profoundly shaped two societies in conflict -- and perhaps one day, conciliation. The course will draw not only from scholarly texts but memoir, literature, photography, film, music, and other forms of digital history to gain a multi-faceted view of the modern Israel. Lastly, students will have the opportunity apply their historical knowledge to contemporary debates about the future of the region."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Through a close-reading of both primary and secondary source material, students will have the opportunity to learn to work with texts (and other media) and negotiate historiographical debates about modern Israel.

To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources.

Each week we will focus on a different genre and examine it through the lens of one film, one television episode, or two songs, creating a close comparative study over the quarter. We will explore significant key themes and moments to understand the conditions of Latinx representation in each media genre. For example, we will investigate how race, age, and gender are depicted in Children's TV series, such as Elena Of Avalor (Disney 2016-2020) and Dora the Explorer (Nickelodeon 2000-2019). We will also consider the close relationship between Latinx audiences and horror films. Together, we will examine the border representation and the war on drugs in border films, such as in Miss Bala (Catherine Hardwicke, 2019), and the representation of gangs and violence in Chicano film, as seen in Mi Familia (Gregory Nava, 1995).  We will consider the role of comedy, humor, and laughter in the representation of Latinidad on sitcoms and TV remakes of Latin American telenovelas, such as Ugly Betty (ABC 2006-2010) and Jane the Virgin (CW 2014-2019).

What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available?  It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves.

Yet it has also been portrayed as a Europeanized outlier (a badge of honor claimed by most Middle Eastern countries), \"a bridge between East and West\" (a clich? also adopted by Eastern European countries, Russia, Iran, Singapore, and the Philippines), an exemplar of moderate Islam and multi-cultural tolerance, and once even an inspiration for the phrase \"Turkish model of democracy\". We will begin this class by exploring why these seemingly contrasting depictions of Turkey are in fact the two sides of the same coin, and how they conceal the colonial and national histories, political dynamics, and global economic inequalities. Drawing on ethnography, social history, and film, we will we will do comparative readings of the historical and contemporary regimes, events, and social movements in Turkey and the Middle East.

The death of the nation-state and the birth of the multinational corporation heralded this new epoch. Yet, in the epoch of off-shored refugee processing centers and border walls, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing to re-conceptualize border as equally the product of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Students will be evaluated on the basis of two 5-7-page papers (50%) and class participation (50%).

As time allows we will explore further related questions, with attention to their philosophical significance."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Pre-req: PHIL 150"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Understand the precise statements of the limitative theorems.  \n\nDistinguish between what the theorems say and philosophical claims about their relevance.  \n\nObtain facility in representing recursive functions in arithmetic theories and solving formal problems concerning formal theories of arithmetic."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Problem sets, exams.

The texts of Hegel, Marx, Tocqueville, Mill, Nietzsche, and Freud pose challenges for us to theorize and critique within these exacting historical circumstances, particularly as they bear upon the fortunes of new modes and orders of domination and political rule on the one hand and emancipatory forms of politics and practices of freedom on the other. But we can also read these texts beyond their \"past\" nineteenth century Eurocentric milieu, in ways that provoke reconsideration of existing assumptions with which we \"present\" moderns have perhaps become too comfortable.

What is \"modern\" about Islamic revivalism and how does it shape Islamic activism? How did Islamic political thought evolve and adapt to changing political circumstances within Muslim societies in an increasingly globalized world? We draw from intellectual history, comparative politics and political theory to examine some of the major ideological currents, political movements and intellectual figures who sought, since the end of the late 19th century, to reconstruct the political and social dimensions of Muslim societies and countries along Islamic lines. The course focuses on the intellectual origins of the resurgence and spread of \"political Islam\". Our readings include primary sources in translation as well as secondary sources from history, Islamic studies, political science, and anthropology. Topics include: decline and revival, Islamic reform, Islam and modernity, rationality, ijtihad (Islamic legal independent reasoning), Shura (deliberative decision- making), Muslim unity, pan-Islamism, Secularism, Sharia, Caliphate, Fundamentalism, Islamic state, Democracy, Islam and the West, Gender (in) equality, Liberal Islam, Human rights, Violence, Jihad..."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Reserved for graduate students.

However, most people have great difficulty understanding infinite sets like these. Are there more positive integers than positive even integers? Are there more rational numbers than natural numbers? Are there more real numbers than rational numbers? You might be surprised at the correct answers to some of these questions. To set the stage, we'll look (informally) at some of the math background on infinity, as developed by Georg Cantor and others in the 19th Century. Then we'll examine some reasons why thinking and reasoning about infinity is so difficult. We'll read some cognitive psychology experiments that address how children first learn about the infinity of the positive integers, how they learn about infinite divisibility, and how older students (NU undergrads) think about number systems in general.\n\nclass: remote/synchronous"}]}],"002874":[{"unique_id":"36500","instructor":{"name":"Wendi L Gardner"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Introduction to Psychology","subject":"PSYCH","number":"110-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"12:20","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"The purpose of this course is to present an overview of the field of psychology.

Students will be expected to build on materials covered in the course by applying narrative theory to the study of religious narratives either Jewish or otherwise. \n\nSome of the works to be used are: Paul Ricouer, Figuring the Sacred; Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Hayden White, \"The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Reality;\" Robert Segal, ed., The Myth and Ritual Theory; Jerome Bruner, The Making of Stories; Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics; Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures; Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class?"},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"graduate students"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Multiple sense of the term \"narrative.\"\nRelationship between various notions of narrative and aspects of religious life and ideology.\nTechniques of reading textual narratives and narrativizing religious ideas."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Paul Ricoeur, Figuring the Sacred; \nSigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo; \nClifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures, \nCatherine Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice"}]}],"008144":[{"unique_id":"35960","instructor":{"name":"Matthew James Chalmers"},"mode":null,"title":"Independent Reading","subject":"RELIGION","number":"490-0","section":"20","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"IND","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35961","instructor":{"name":"Christine M Helmer"},"mode":null,"title":"Independent Reading","subject":"RELIGION","number":"490-0","section":"21","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"IND","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35962","instructor":{"name":"Stephanie Nicole Brehm"},"mode":null,"title":"Independent Reading","subject":"RELIGION","number":"490-0","section":"22","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"IND","course_descriptions":[]}],"002307":[{"unique_id":"35937","instructor":{"name":"Sarah Hieatt Jacoby"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"20","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35938","instructor":{"name":"Mark Richard McClish"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"21","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35939","instructor":{"name":"Kevin Delaney Buckelew"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"22","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35940","instructor":{"name":"Robert A Orsi"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"23","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35941","instructor":{"name":"Sarah McFarland Taylor"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"24","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35942","instructor":{"name":"Brannon Dobbs Ingram"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"25","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"35943","instructor":{"name":"Barry Scott Wimpfheimer"},"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar","subject":"RELIGION","number":"570-3","section":"26","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"RSC","course_descriptions":[]}],"003218":[{"unique_id":"35864","instructor":{"name":"Thomas   Feerick"},"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Elementary Russian (Prior to 2019 taught as SLAVIC 101-3)","subject":"RUSSIAN","number":"101-3","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoTuWeFr","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"9:50","room":null,"start_date":"2021-03-30","end_date":"2021-06-05","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"101-3: Elementary Russian 101-3 is the third part in a three-quarter sequence designed to introduce students to the Russian language and contemporary Russian culture.

To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources.

The course will consider impact of these ideologies on subject formation by reviewing their progression over time through theoretical arguments and evidence from case studies. Because race has been central to the forms of power and authority that first undergirded the colonial system and later birthed the many Latin American nations, we can trace a continued line of transmission of racialized ideologies that structure inequality in the region. Using a cultural and linguistic anthropological framework, we will approach these racial categories as composites of markers of otherness that include skin color, clothing, kin affiliations, occupation, among others. The course moves progressively from research about the early colonial period and forward chronologically until the 20th century, with a final discussion of migrant trajectories to the US.

First, it seeks to familiarize students with Latin American intellectual traditions in the modern period.  In order to do so, it surveys a representative selection of pivotal figures in three different, and crucial, historical moments: the post-revolutionary 19th century and its responses both to Independence and an emerging neocolonial order; the frenetic 1920s and 30s and the articulations of a properly Latin American identity and culture; and the late 20th century, which has witnessed an attempt to reckon with the repercussions of the revolutionary projects of the mid-century. Second, within and across these historical constellations, the course will analyze prominent conceptual paradigms that have defined intellectual discourse in the region, such as mestizaje, hybridity, and heterogeneity, focusing particularly on their evolution and metamorphoses.  As we consider the advent and waning of elite, lettered production's influence and power to shape national and regional conceptualizations, we will pay special attention to how alterity and coloniality inflect the region's intellectual production.

How do these varied forms of orality and literacy shape and distort colonial encounters and conflicts? How do they continue to inform the field of colonial Latin American studies today? How can we push at the seams of this classic conundrum by thinking about visual literacy, mediascapes, sensoria, and embodied knowledge?
