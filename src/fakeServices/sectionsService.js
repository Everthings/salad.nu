Because science is vast and you each have unique interests, assignments may be satisfied with work focused on medical advances, public health, technology, the environment, space exploration, physics or other areas of your choice. You can approach COVID-19 stories from wide-ranging perspectives, including the increased risks from the pandemic in neighborhoods of Chicago and elsewhere with high pollution levels. Some assignments for this class will be stories that can be published.?

The externship work will be guided by Northwestern University and governmental policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the externship, you will participate in a weekly online seminar class. Class topics and readings will relate to the work of the federal judiciary and may include opinion drafting, ethical considerations, and specific parts of the litigation process, such as settlement conferences and sentencing. Guest speakers will join us, as well, throughout the semester. You will maintain reflective journals analyzing your field placement experiences and class topics and responding to questions about their externship. The class offers opportunities for you to improve on a variety of skills used by lawyers, including research, analysis, writing, listening, and presentation. You secure your own externships with the assistance of the professor, and all placements must be approved by the professor. The externship must run concurrently with the course.

These judgments call for more than mere logic - they call for inferences about motive and character, and they call on decision makers to incorporate emotions like anger and sympathy. Despite general pronouncements that the criminal law condemns conduct, the law encourages - and sometimes demands -- that prosecutors, judges, and jurors make inferences about the defendant's motive and moral character. As the Model Penal Code drafters wrote [about voluntary manslaughter], \"In the end, the question is whether the actor's loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen.\" A similar standard is arguably at work for grading thresholds like first v. second degree murder, elements like proximate causation, defenses like duress and use of force, and in sentencing decisions.\n\nIn this seminar, we will critically explore how racial dynamics frame prosecutors', judges', and jurors' interpretations of questions that, at bottom, call for moral judgments of mental states, motivations, and reasonableness."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Registration is by permission only.

Specific issues to be covered include organizational design and structure, organizational complexity, college and university governance (including board, administrative, and faculty governance), organizational culture and its effect on those working in organizations, and organizational leadership.  Students will develop an understanding of the linkages between theory and practice of organizations, and learn how to apply this knowledge to their daily work.  They will also develop and enhance their abilities to effectively write and speak about structural, governance, and leadership issues.

Why do domesticated cats make for good memes but not a good meal? Would Smokey the Bear be an effective symbol of environmentalism if he was Smokey the Skunk - or if \"he\" was \"she\"? From Mickey Mouse to Grumpy Cat to Smokey the Bear, nonhuman animals are omnipresent media figures. And these animals, despite not being human?or maybe because they're not human?can tell us a lot about how we understand ourselves and the world around us. In this course, students will develop a cultural understanding of animal-related media from early cinema to today. Together we will build the vocabulary to describe humanity's complex relationships with animals and reflect on our participation in these human-animal dynamics. Weekly topics are organized around concepts central to humanity's cultural categorizations and power differentials. Questions addressed include: How do humans and nonhuman animals each figure into historical notions of \"wild\"/\"pristine\"/\"wondrous\" nature? How does media work to constitute racialized and animalized subjects? How are discourses of the \"natural\" deployed in popular media depictions of animal sexuality and reproduction? Selected weekly viewings will feature familiar examples of animal media like animated films (Dumbo, Zootopia) and wildlife documentaries (March of the Penguins, Planet Earth) but also a wide range of other media, including video games, advertisements, gifs, Instagram accounts, drone videos, crittercams, audio field recordings, and more.

What happens when somebody produces a show that challenges viewers and viewers respond to the challenge? What happens when a program seeks to get \"couch potatoes\" out of their living rooms and into the streets or deeper into their own minds? This course presents a history of alternative television, or perhaps better expressed as an alternative history of television. The course focuses on unorthodox views of American television and television as a medium in general to illustrate a more complex and often subversive history than is conventionally understood. In this era of overtly politically polarized programming such as that presented on Fox News and MSNBC and resistance often coming through the belief that much of what is presented is \"fake news,\" it is important to understand that mass media is a constructed entity; one whose tropes and conventions have been subject to resistance in some form since its inception. Ideological and technical choices made nearly a century ago by large corporations like CBS and NBC have had consequences throughout the existence of the medium of broadcast television. Students will discover that that the unidirectional, commercial nature of television is not a given, nor has it ever been, and that they can use critical thinking and an understanding of history to gain a deeper understanding of the medium and the cultural norms it promulgates to this day.\n\nIn this course, we will examine American television programming such as the experimental variety shows of Ernie Kovacs, the improvised puppet shows of Burr Tillstrom, the psychedelic work of Nam June Paik and Joanne Kyger, education programming such as Sesame Street, and politically engaged video collectives like Top Value Television and VideoFreex. The course will conclude by addressing recent developments such as the rise of YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, and Northwestern Professor A.J. Christian's Open TV platform. We will engage with the scholarship of Raymond Williams, Lynn Spigel, DeeDee Halleck, Aniko Bodroghkozy, and Herman Gray, among others. Students are expected to screen assigned programming on their own and be prepared for weekly class discussions. These shows will be available on Canvas, Netflix, and YouTube. All readings will be available through Canvas.

We will consider significant film, television, and digital media documentaries about LGBTQ issues, including the first documentaries to include queer and transgender people in their content, as well as the ways in which LGBTQ activists and producers have protested against and/or shaped these images.

of class","desc":"Ever since we declared its pursuit as one of our inalienable rights, Americans have been hot on the trail of a happiness that often seems to be just beyond our grasp. The hunt takes many paths: finding love, wealth, or fame; earning an education, job, or lifestyle; attaining bliss, heaven, or a fairy tale ending. This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: \"is happiness a goal or a journey?\" We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture.\n\nThe course is conducted completely online. It will be asynchronous; students can participate in discussions and complete assignments by working at their own pace, as long as deadlines are met. A technology fee will be added to tuition."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"ENGLISH 110 or equivalent.\n\nNOTE: This course is limited to School of Professional Studies students only.

Two interrelated topics are central to the course:  (a) the patron-client organizational structures of \"warlord\" insurgencies, and (b) the communicative practices, meaning-making, and decision-making that constitute the daily life of such organizations. The second topic is clarified using the semiotic and communication theory of Charles Sanders Peirce. Methods and concepts developed in the course are grounded in a wide range of ethnographic case material, such as genocide in Rwanda, sexual violence in Darfur, as well as cases based on the instructor's research on the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone. \n\nCross-listed with Pol Sci 390-0"}]}],"001195":[{"unique_id":"41799","instructor":{"name":"Marquis Donnell Bey"},"instructors":["Marquis Donnell Bey"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Introduction to African-American Studies","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"236-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoTuThFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"13:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-06-21","end_date":"2021-07-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"016191":[{"unique_id":"41801","instructor":{"name":"Marquis Donnell Bey"},"instructors":["Marquis Donnell Bey"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Race, Class and Gender","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"250-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoTuThFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"13:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-07-06","end_date":"2021-07-18","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[]}],"001218":[{"unique_id":"41800","instructor":{"name":"John David Marquez"},"instructors":["John David Marquez"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Topics in African-American Studies","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"380-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoTuWeTh","start_time":"13:30","end_time":"17:00","room":null,"start_date":"2021-07-06","end_date":"2021-07-18","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"001094":[{"unique_id":"41678","instructor":{"name":"Matilda Lynn Stubbs"},"instructors":["Matilda Lynn Stubbs"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Culture & Society","subject":"ANTHRO","number":"211-0","section":"26","meeting_days":"MoWeFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"12:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-06-21","end_date":"2021-07-18","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This class is an introduction to cultural anthropology - the study of cultural variation from a global perspective. Readings, lectures, and films explore this diversity through the lens of childhood and adolescence, drawing from the fieldwork of anthropologists and ethnographic research. These cross-cultural studies examine the ways children are socialized, including how childhood and adolescence are conceptualized, embodied, and experienced in different local settings. From Zambian youth delivering in-home healthcare, Senegalese youth practices on social media, to experiences of race, ethnicity, and nationality for Latinx youth in Chicago, all of these examples consider the interrelated factors - social, economic, demographic, and symbolic - that determine the organization of the family, the value and meaning of children, and the place of youth in communities, schools, and the marketplace. As much as people share beliefs and practices in common, historical and cultural constructions, like that of the life stage known as \"childhood,\" influence domains as varied as morality, intelligence, sexuality, and identity. In order to appreciate how qualitative research can expand understandings on these topics, course activities provide experiential learning opportunities to engage with ethnographic research methods like participant-observation and interviewing, in order to understand how fieldwork observations and interpretive analysis are context dependent."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"1.\tDevelop a working understanding of culture, cultural relativity, and ethnocentrism.\n2.\tExamine the diverse ways that anthropology as a discipline studies social life through participant-observation and ethnography, including the potential for these methods to address contemporary cross-cultural phenomena.\n3.\tDemonstrate the ability to interpret cultural behavior, both past and present, in comparative terms through digital ethnographic exercises, virtual class discussion, and written assignments."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Discussion, presentations, papers."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"?\tBucholtz, M. 2011.

While focusing on the United States, this course offers a comparative perspective to illustrate how anti-Muslim racism is a global phenomenon, entwined with other forms of racism such as anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-Semitism, and anti-indigenous racisms.

of class","desc":"A stranger is typically someone we do not know or a foreigner who belongs to another country and speaks another language. However, we can also be a stranger at home or a stranger to ourselves. In this course, we will consider the tensions between these two understandings by looking at texts in which characters are perceived as strangers in their own countries or are strangers to themselves. Focusing on twentieth and twenty-first-century literature, we will ask what it means to be a \"stranger at home,\" and how the figure of the stranger or foreigner is constructed; what institutional, political, affective, and social power structures influence who counts as a stranger. We will examine how race and gender play into the representation of the stranger and feelings of estrangement. Beginning with important theoretical writings on the figure of the stranger including but not limited to George Simmel, Julia Kristeva, and Sara Ahmed, the course then considers the works of writers such as Albert Camus, Kamel Daoud, Marie Ndiaye, Ousmane Semb?ne, and Claudia Rankine coming from France, Algeria, Senegal, and the United States to explore the themes of estrangement, belonging, citizenship, rootedness, cultural and social identity, as well as immigration. We will begin with the Mediterranean and move beyond to embrace a global framework in which we position each text in its transnational and historical context to underline the colonial legacies and commonalities between seemingly disparate literary traditions. By the end of the course, students will have reflected on how their own identity and positionality inform their relationship to others and better understand the underpinnings of racism and xenophobia. We will also explore the opportunities and challenges of belonging as human beings and citizens in the world."}]}],"023045":[{"unique_id":"41407","instructor":{"name":"Eloisa   Bressan"},"instructors":["Eloisa   Bressan"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Literatures in Translation","subject":"COMP_LIT","number":"270-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWeFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"12:00","room":null,"start_date":"2021-06-21","end_date":"2021-08-01","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"The divide between the city and the countryside is one of the most enduring ideas shaping cultural, political, and social imagination.

How have Italian and French literature shaped these dreams and promises of the relationship between the city and the countryside?and its realities?\n\n\nIn this class, we will examine realist novels (by Flaubert, Zola, Verga) and neorealist movies (by Visconti and Rossellini) to explore the divide between the city and the countryside as it develops across time and media, from literary realism in the late 19th century, to cinematographic neorealism in the 20th."}]}],"018661":[{"unique_id":"41406","instructor":{"name":"Omoyemi Sayo   Ajisebutu"},"instructors":["Omoyemi Sayo   Ajisebutu"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Studies in World Literature","subject":"COMP_LIT","number":"301-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"11:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-06-21","end_date":"2021-08-01","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"We often think of the literature of Diaspora as a great \"scattering\" of writers who have emigrated from the Global South to the spaces of the Global North, but in the last few years a new genre of African literature tells stories of \"return\" from the U.S. and the U.K. to Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. This course explores the phenomenon of the diaspora from the standpoint of these narratives of return. How do writers like Teju Cole, NoViolet Bulawayo, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie fashion new understandings of African identity through their narratives of homecoming as a kind of \"reverse diaspora?\" How do they craft ideas of home, homelessness and belonging in their narratives of the perils of reintegration into a former society? To investigate these questions, we will also study how these writers draw on literary and philosophical ideas such as existentialism and phenomenology.

We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network.

In this entrenched relationship between folklore and the nation, what has been the role of trans* and queer individuals when national identity is often thought in heterosexual terms? This course serves as an introduction to the study of folklore with a particular emphasis on the ways trans* and queer populations have challenged through performance the heteronormative views of folklore as an ideology and narrative. We will focus our attention on dance and parade performance in folkloric expressions such as carnivals, religious patron-saint festivals, and ballet folkl?rico. To ground our study in the local, we will utilize primary and secondary sources including performance recordings, films, (auto)ethnographical accounts, oral history, and academic writings. In this process, we will examine how tradition, religion, race and ethnicity, class, authenticity, indigeneity, and the nation have been contested terms in defining folklore.Each week, we will zoom in on a particular geographical region or country in the Americas such as the Andes, the Caribbean, Brazil, Mexico and the United States to account for an hemispheric view of trans* and queer folklore.

We will critically analyze the U.S.-led \"war on drugs\" and some of the alternatives that have been proposed. The course is divided in three broad sections. The first provides an overview of the drugs problem; we will define the term \"drug\", identify types of drugs, and briefly look at the history drug production and transportation, mostly in Central and South America, and current trends in consumption in the U.S. The second part of the course looks at specific links between drugs and politics, mostly in Latin America and the U.S. We will explore the patterns of drug-related violence and the theories that have been proposed to explain them; we will study why drug trafficking groups often operate as de facto rulers in local communities, and trace the consequences on common citizens; and we will investigate what drives participation in illicit drug markets.
