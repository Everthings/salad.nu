Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders.\n\nThe world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today's workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.\n\nReaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.\n\nBeyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well. Millennials and Gen Z entering the workforce are looking for companies, which have strong social responsibility commitments and offer ways for employees to participate.",

To do this, we will examine psychological, economic, communications, anthropological and sociological perspectives on human action that will allow us to generate consumer insights. Knowledge of consumer behavior is essential for key strategic tasks including environmental analyses, product positioning, branding, segmentation, and the implementation of integrated and effective communications strategies. The purpose of this course is to introduce, discuss, understand, and analyze consumers' lives to provide students the building blocks for developing consumer centric and value oriented products, experiences, and brand communications as part of an effective IMC program.

We will build our expertise through rigorous reporting and thoughtful interviews with players on all sides of this enduring debate. The historical record is central to the equation, as is politics, especially with Evanston becoming one of the first cities in the country to pursue reparations for past racism, and Minneapolis drawing national attention. The class will make a reporting trip to Minneapolis in May. This workshop, taught by Peter Slevin, a contributing writer for The New Yorker, will start with questions, not answers.

In addition, it will also provide connections to corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, and the responses and debates across science research, news and international policy contexts.  \n\nThe seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues. \n\nOver the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing,  the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history.  \n\nThese and many more issues?air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust?have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media.",

Further complicating the reporting environment is the rising hostility toward the media, partly the result of deliberate attempts to undermine journalistic credibility, which has led officials and the public to increasingly turn to the courts to attack journalists and suppress information. This course will review the laws, legal cases and ethical standards essential to being a journalist in the 21st Century -- not only for what you report and publish, but also for what you post on social media -- including defamation, privacy, information access, protecting confidential sources, and copyright.",

It provides an opportunity to hear from African journalists working in one of the world's newest democracies and to compare and contrast their experience with the increasingly contested role of reporters in the U.S., the world's oldest constitutional republic. Both countries recently experienced constitutional crises provoked by the behavior of unconventional chief executives who considered the conventions of journalism an existential threat. In both places, Covid-19 hit hard, revealing weaknesses and patterns of discrimination in public health systems. Speaking directly with journalists, activists, publishers, producers and media executives, we'll explore the state of independent journalism in South Africa and take stock of startups particularly well-adapted to reporting on the content. We'll center our exploration on several key questions: What relevance does the governing party's promise to produce a \"nonracial,\" egalitarian, anti-sexist, and non-homophobic society on the southern tip of Africa have for social justice movements here? And what are current expectations about journalism's role in bolstering those values? Drawing from radio, television, print, and online sites, we'll zero in on ethical considerations for doing exemplary journalism across lines of nationality, class, culture, language, ethnicity, race, age, gender and other considerations.",

In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

Students will work on a longer feature (with approval from the instructor you can pursue projects already underway), along with a couple of shorter writing assignments which we will workshop in class. We will also read some of the best nonfiction writing out there, and dissect those stories so we can come to understand how a writer builds a story, from conception to writing.

This seminar is designed for you to develop valuable understandings about politics and skills in political journalism as you produce portfolio-worthy coverage on topics many and varied and shaped to your interests. Expect to explore reporting strategies and political issues, going into the field to consider and cover issues important to voters. Along the way, we'll study policies, personalities and political messaging, going far beyond the horserace coverage that too often dominates headlines and obscures the meaningful and thoughtful work that matters to voters and the republic. For your final project, expect to choose an issue that matters to you and go deep. Analyses, questions and random notions that challenge conventional wisdom are encouraged.

The seminar discussion experience of integrating different key voices builds from the discussion of critical treaty-based rights that were negotiated as part of the foundation of US as nation-state, into issues related to air and water quality, mining, land-to-trust status that connect territorial rights to many other human and cultural rights. The seminar also discusses the connections between US cases and corresponding international Indigenous environmental issues, addressing the responses and debates across media, science research, news and international policy bodies, and more specifically how the journalist coverage of Native American environmental issues contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy.  \n\nThe seminar provides critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles in national and international contexts, understanding the controversies around cultural, knowledge and governance systems, and the differences of participation of Indigenous Peoples in informed decision-making processes. The central case study of the seminar will be the impact of mining in Wisconsin Indian Country, Menominee Nation and the Back 40 Mine Project, to address the impact of mining and energy on territorial rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues in Indigenous Peoples territories that also involve oil and gas pipelines, dams, and infrastructure development at urban micro to large rural scale.",

Nimmer, Cases and Materials on Copyright and Other Aspects of Entertainment Litigation, Eighth Edition, 2012, published by LEXIS/NEXIS. The latter one third portion of the course will center largely on selected cases and other source materials that will be available on Westlaw (or will otherwise be supplied or made available to you).    \nStudents should come to class having prepared the reading assigned for that class, ready for discussion. Informed discussion of the ideas embodied within the reading materials is one of the objects of this seminar.  Class participation will count towards the student\'s final grade.  For each class, a number of cases or materials, identified below, representing a portion of the assigned reading for that class will form the basis for the class discussion.  Familiarity with all of the assigned reading for that week, however, will be assumed. Each class session has designated "Additional Readings"; these are NOT mandatory or required in any way, but are helpful resources and will provide additional context for the materials discussed in that particular class.  Also, you can count on being advised of new developments during the semester via email and Canvas; as you will see, this is a volatile and dynamic area of the law. Class attendance is not mandatory but useful, given the wide-ranging nature of class discussions and the scheduled presentations; given that the class is a seminar, contributions by students form a material part of the class content.   Due to the class schedule and calendar constraints, we anticipate one or more "make-up" sessions during the semester.   You will be notified in advance of these sessions.  BE PREPARED for alterations in the scheduled class content; we may have outside guest-lecturers; you will get notice of these alterations.  \nThe principal course requirements will be (1) a paper (counting for approximately 70% of the final grade), on an approved topic, and (2) three graded, hands-on, practical projects, which will be administered in three different class sessions, counting for approximately 30% of the final grade.  As stated, class participation will figure in each student\'s final grade so that component will have some influence on class attendance.  Paper topics should be selected as early in the semester as possible.  Papers will be due not later than the last day of the exam period.',

In addition to the weekly seminar, students spend 12 hours per week in an approved externship with a non-profit public interest organization doing civil legal work. Students work under the supervision of attorneys in these offices and conduct research, write briefs and memoranda, interview clients and witnesses, participate in community education efforts, and assist attorneys in trial preparation and trial.

You will write reflective journal entries analyzing your work experiences and different class topics and responding to prompts. You will submit your journal two times over the course of the semester. After you hand in the 1st journal installment, I will provide you with feedback to help you improve on your 2nd journal installment. You will give a workshop to the class on a topic of your choosing towards the end of the semester. As part of the workshop, you will present your research on that particular topic in an engaging, interactive way and facilitate a brief discussion. Class attendance and participation will be graded based on efforts, not on whether answers are right or wrong. In addition, successful compliance with the externship requirements and the expectations of your placement supervisor are essential. Although the field placement experience will not be graded directly, I will be in contact with your supervisor during the semester to discuss your work. Failure to comply with the requirements and expectations of your externship may have an impact on your grade. You will get individual feedback and guidance from me on your journals, workshop topic and outline, and anything else that relates to the class through conferences during the semester, and you can meet with me more, as needed.",

Not only does foreign law matter to U.S. lawyers in international business or international arbitration, but it is important within national law (consider Chicago litigation involving a contract governed by French law or a Miami resident bequeathing real estate in Italy). Indeed, a comprehensive ABA survey reveals that after 7 years of practice, 44% of U.S. lawyers report work involving foreign law, a figure that reaches 66% for lawyers in large firms and 65% for those working as inside counsel. However, the \"handling\" of foreign law raises formidable challenges. Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a U.S. lawyer? How to optimize one's understanding of foreign law? Are there methods, techniques, or strategies that can overcome differences across laws, languages, and cultures ? that can give reliable access to foreign law's singularity? How best to proceed, and what can be achieved? Meanwhile, many claim that U.S. courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Note that this course, despite its focus, finds itself effectively ranging beyond the issue of foreign law. This is because many of the insights derived from an examination of the hurdles attendant upon foreign-law interaction also prove useful in situations involving national law only.

While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.\"\n\nTo be sure, Hand was hopeful that a fierce commitment to liberty - along with a constellation of other critical constitutional values -- did course within the American people, reflecting and cementing the protections provided under law. But if Hand's optimism was (and is) well-placed, it bears asking: How have these constitutional values been forged within American hearts, minds, and culture? How have public conversations, discussions, and debates about the meaning of the United States Constitution unfolded? And what might those exchanges, located in our past, reveal about how Americans view the Constitution's guarantees within their own lives today?\n\nThis course, focused on American public constitutional discourse, will address these questions. Specifically, we will assess and compare the public persuasion dimensions of an eclectic series of constitutional controversies. Fusing legal history, rhetorical criticism, communication research, political science, and constitutional theory, we will analyze the public arguments advanced by advocates during these episodes, the methods used to do so, and their success or failure with key public audiences. \n\nWe will also investigate the discursive manner by which Americans - in print and at the podium, and across legislative hearing rooms, law school classrooms, and family living rooms -- have built a constitutional culture, and the degree to which that public culture: (a) informs individual and community expectations regarding freedom, democracy, and equality; (b) reinforces core constitutional precepts of rights, judicial legitimacy, institutional balance, and the rule of law; and (c) reflects, invites, and shapes the exercise of citizenship.",

You will be taught how to draft agreements in a formal, but modern, style free of archaic language, redundancies, and legalese.',

You will receive feedback on each assignment, and they will serve as building blocks for the final assignment (due at the beginning of the exam period), which will require you to draft a complete contract.

We will study the relevant statutes and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that govern sentencing submissions and proceedings. We will then review selected Sentencing Guidelines, with a focus on those guidelines regulating drug offenses. In conjunction with this discussion we will touch on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the Holder and Sessions memoranda, and the First Step Act. \n \nThe class will be co-taught by a seasoned criminal law practitioner and former staff attorney at the Federal Defender for the Northern District of Illinois, Doug Whitney of Douglas Whitney Law Offices LLC. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and members of the United States Sentencing Commission will visit the class to offer their perspectives on sentencing law and practice.",

The workshop papers will reflect a variety of legal history topics and methods, including socio-legal history, global histories of law, and research in the history of legal ideas. The seminar will bring together scholar-presenters, Northwestern law students and faculty, as well as faculty and graduate students from Northwestern, the American Bar Foundation, and Chicago-area universities. \nStudents' writing assignment will consist of writing a few brief response papers (requiring no independent research) to some of the papers presented.",

Working with an Ethiopian NGO and U.S. and Canadian partner NGOs, we'll be continuing advocacy efforts on behalf of an indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination (mercury, arsenic, etc.) from the Lega Dembi gold mine. Details of what we'll do depend on evolving circumstances, but we may write submissions to UN human rights mechanisms, continue our efforts to force the government to make public the results of impact assessments, utilize European laws and regulations or industry self-regulatory standards with respect to the supply chain obligations of the Swiss refinery that has purchased the gold from this mine, and explore possibilities within the African HR system. 2. We have been asked by two women's rights NGOs in Myanmar to analyze the results of a survey questionnaire on the security situation of women in Myanmar following the military coup, to write a report based on these results, and to engage in international advocacy using the report. 3. We are collaborating with EQUAL GROUND, a Sri Lanka LGBTIQ NGO, to prepare submissions for the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Human Rights Council's UPR mechanism regarding human rights violations against LGVTIQ people in Sri Lanka.  4.  Working with the newly-founded Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability, we will continue work begun last year to determine whether grounds exist to hold corporate actors in the gold and diamond sectors criminally liable for complicity in crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic. 5. We may add another project - perhaps in collaboration with a legal clinic in either Arequipa, Peru, or Tbilisi, Georgia.  Do you have an idea of a HR project you would like to work on? I am always open to student suggestions for projects that are suitable for this clinic, though whether we can proceed with an idea this coming semester depends on time demands of all projects.",

Subjects covered include planning for the marital deduction; use of the gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptions; annual exclusion and other lifetime gifts; planning for IRAs and other retirement benefits; grantor trust planning -including sales to grantor trusts, installment notes, grantor retained annuity trusts and personal residence trusts; charitable planning with  charitable lead and remainder trusts; business succession planning, asset protection planning, and the use of family limited partnerships and limited liability companies. An examination of the efficacy of these techniques and a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages will be an integral part of this course. Current developments, fiduciary duties and powers and ethical issues will also be carefully considered.",

The hope is not to necessarily become great artists, but rather learn to quickly and effectively communicate ideas with others. We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see.\n \nWe will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.\n \nWe will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources. Reading and exercises will be provided on a project-by-project basis and you will also be encouraged to explore other types of visual communication that you find interesting in the development of concepts.",

We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors ? for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce students to key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity and organizational environments. Throughout the class, students will be expected to constantly apply the constructs and ideas to particular cases of organizational change.",

In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations, document what's working and what's not, and figure out creative ways to redesign them. You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across personal, professional, and community. Course readings are varied and include literature from cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, design, and other disciplines. Classes will be highly interactive, including a mix of discussion of the readings and our experiences in the field, short mini-lectures, and extended group activities.

This course is the most focused on learning of any LOC course. However, in contrast to a typical learning sciences or cognitive science, most of the material in this course is set in organizational contexts. For example, when discussing judgment and decision making, we use examples from medical practice. Experts from each organizational context participate in the relevant class sessions whenever possible. A key component of the class is a group research project on a topic of your choice. Through this project, you will learn about a variety of methods, including instructional design and evaluation of learning outcomes. It will help prepare you to design and evaluate learning programs and learning environments. Thus the course is appropriate for students who might become teachers, researchers, consultants, etc.",

In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations, document what's working and what's not, and figure out creative ways to redesign them.  You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. We'll also look critically and creatively at the values and principles that anchor our designs for change.  The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across professional, community, and personal contexts.",

It is the assumption of this course that we will be in a better position to achieve these goals if we can somehow characterize the knowledge that individuals possess at any given time, and how this knowledge changes as they learn.\n\nThe characterization of knowledge is the business of this course. We will explore the techniques of knowledge representation, primarily as practiced by cognitive scientists. Our goals in this regard are both theoretical and methodological. We will examine various theoretical perspectives on the nature of knowledge, and we will practice various methodological and analytical techniques for studying the knowledge possessed by individuals.\n\nThe course will be divided into three main parts. We will begin with an introduction to knowledge representation. As part of this introduction, students will learn a "toolkit" of knowledge forms that can be used to describe knowledge. This initial exploration will be carried out within a number of learning domains, including mathematics, reading, and science.\n\nThen, in the second part of the course, we will employ our toolkit to describe how the knowledge of individuals changes as they learn. Finally, in the last part week of the course, we will explore some additional topics, including the relationships among recent developments in machine learning and studies of learning in the Learning Sciences.',

A wave of recent scholarship has examined the nefarious impact of new technologies on racial equity (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018), social and economic justice (Eubanks, 2018), teaching and learning processes in schools (Watters, 2021), and on the health and survival of the planet itself (Crawford, 2021). Learning about the politics of technologies, and the technologies of power, is thus emerging as one of the most significant needs in education. Building from Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives, in this course we shift our analytic focus to the politics of engineering education institutions (Lucena, 2013; Riley, 2003). What are the historical, cultural, and political forces operating on these institutions? How do they cultivate particular kinds of engineering identities? We will ground these inquiries through case studies of specific engineering education institutions in diverse global contexts (Indonesia, India, Denmark, Iran, Chile, Kenya, and the US). Across the cases, we will carefully examine how themes such as modernization, globalization, nationalism, and militarism have shaped the content, character, and ontology of engineering education. Ultimately, we will work towards a critical, global understanding of the power, responsibility, and possibilities for socially just and ethical engineering education.",

Topics to be considered include the development of the liberal arts college, the land grant institution, the research university, the manifold forms of independent and proprietary higher education, and the tension between democratic and elitist values.  The course will also consider the ways in which race, gender, and social class shape patterns of institutional and public policy development in higher education.\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to analyze primary and secondary historical sources, evaluate historical questions from multiple perspectives, write well-reasoned and evidence-based essays, and communicate their ideas effectively in groups and class discussions. This course aims to provide a foundation to locate questions about institutional policy, practice, and discourse in the historical, political, and economic contexts that have shaped the development of higher education in the United States and to which higher education institutions continue to adapt.",

While there are myriad stakeholders who lay claim to each of these issues, the enrollment manager is often the central figure charged with understanding and articulating the policies, practices, and tradeoffs necessary to achieve an institution's objectives around access, enrollment, and retention. This course is designed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the enrollment management profession, beginning with an understanding of the factors that shape student's college choice decisions and extending into the realms of marketing, admissions, financial aid, tuition planning, and retention. In approaching each of these critical areas, the course will focus on theory, policy, and practice through a variety of readings, classroom exercises, and discussions. Overlaying each of the class sessions will be a critical emphasis on understanding why enrollment disparities across race and socioeconomic status continue to characterize our higher education system, and how we might envision a more just society through the development of policies and practices that confront the continued reproduction of social inequality in the American educational system.",

Through our 1) generous listening & dialogue, 2) critical analyses of empirical & theoretical data and 3) deep thinking & writing, we will wrestle with a number of ideas and perspectives. Yet, central to this course is knowledge of the myriad, though sometimes nuanced ways that racism has and continues to operate as a tool of exclusion, disenfranchisement and violence towards individual persons and communities. Equally important, are the intellectual, sociopolitical and pedagogical efforts of individual and collective entities to resist, persist and thrive in the face of injustices.",

Psychological, interpersonal, social, cognitive, moral and physical development will be studied within the contexts of family, peer group, and school.  Theoretical perspectives will be explored in relation to empirical research, field studies, first person accounts, and imaginative works.  Special emphasis will be given to the adolescent's subjective experience and to the remembered accounts of our own adolescence.  The course will encompass a life course/life span perspective by exploring the period following adolescence proper (often referred to in the literature as emerging adulthood) to include adult midlife.  The course will argue that understanding adolescence is advanced with a corresponding appreciation of adulthood.",

Students are supported through all stages of the design of a year-long independent research project. The quarter will culminate in a complete research proposal that will be put into action during the students' senior year.  In addition to the hard work of design and proposal development, as young and developing scholars, students are challenged throughout the quarter to consider the implications of assuming the role of knowledge producer and to think through the responsibilities inherent within this work.  This process is fostered through thoughtful, critical analysis of published scholarship, evaluation of the costs/benefits and quality of others' work, and careful reflection on the students' own positionalities and design choices.  Class time will include \"how-to\" lectures providing direct instruction on elements of research design and proposal writing, as well as combining seminar style-discussion of theoretical and pragmatic/practical issues integral to high quality research and a workshop format, providing students with regular, real-time, dynamic feedback from both instructors and peers.",

It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.\n\nThe first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents.",

To do so, students will learn a formalized, systematic way to observe and analyze one or more mobile applications of their choice. Through research and observation, we will develop an original argument about how that app communicates its values. We will learn the language of technology research and design, take a critical eye to the interfaces we use everyday, and develop skills in writing, revision, and giving and receiving feedback.

Now think about how advertising is integrated into your enjoyment of those things?and how you can encounter advertising nearly everywhere you look: billboards, public transit, ad-supported streaming, product placements, sponsored content, etc. It's clear that media are omnipresent in our lives, in one form or another, but what (or who) determines the shape they take? How do they influence our decision-making, and in what ways do they shape our beliefs? Perhaps most importantly, how are important societal issues and ideological struggles represented in the media? In this course, we will explore the evolution of mass media in the West (and abroad) through historical texts and research articles that enhance our understanding of the ways in which mass media has transformed our culture.\nBeyond offering a theoretical/historical perspective on mass media, the course material should also provide you with conceptual equipment to deconstruct and evaluate new media forms as they emerge, and consider how they might be used to effect change (for better or worse). How might media distort or align perceptions of ourselves and reality? How does it engage and hold our attention? How does it facilitate the transmission of arguments and ideas?and what does it demand of its audience in exchange?

We will read analytic works and discuss the perspective that scholars take in studying their chosen subjects. Second, through independent research projects, students will undertake the practice of rhetorical analysis for themselves. The class readings and the independent projects should inform one another; the readings should assist students in inventing their own perspectives and approaches, and students\\' ongoing independent projects should illuminate class discussion.

The class format will focus on developing critical thinking by fostering discovery of knowledge through intentionally ambiguous assignments that will require students to delve deeply into the published literature and to explore discerningly those resources that extend beyond the boundaries of the textbook and course lectures. This style of learning, while critical for developing a strong clinical practice, may be initially uncomfortable, and unsettling for some. Some of the class content will be taught in more traditional lectures. Much of the content will be explored through group and individual learning activities (during and outside of class). Consequently, the quality of the course depends on each student and their preparation for each class.\n\nFor many lectures, visual and audio materials including PowerPoint slides, video and audio recordings will be used to enhance classroom learning. Given the active learning and discussion-based format of the course, material will be presented that is not specifically included in the PowerPoint slides, PDF overheads, video, and audio materials. Students are responsible for all information presented in lectures and from the assigned readings.\n\nThe reading load for the course is commensurate with graduate training. The required course readings are designed to complement information presented in the course lectures, to provide a foundation for team learning activities, and to contextualize the concepts presented in the course lectures within the relevant published literature.",

Films and TV also may appeal to different viewing pleasures, for example, the Netflix show Squid Game and Boots Riley's film Sorry to Bother You both offer prominent, but different critiques of contemporary capitalism. Moreover, different genre conventions contextualize real-world issues in their unique ways. This course examines how different media formats, genres, and modes of delivery of entertainment film and television frame and comment on social and political issues of their times. Through screenings, discussions, readings, and writing assignments, the course will examine both the affordances and shortcomings of the politically inflected entertainment media, in the US and abroad.

Although we often think of new media as synonymous with the internet and digital technology, this course will navigate the emergence of various new media from the late 19th century through our current era with an emphasis on gender and race. Working chronologically, this course will highlight key technological innovations including the rise of early cinema, television, and computers. From Black owned ?picture palaces' in the 1910s to Indigenous women creating VR in the 2010s, this course centers an understanding of women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC as consistent designers and users of emerging technology.\n\nEach week will center around scholarly and primary source materials that illuminate perspectives on how gender and race informed the dynamic relationship between users and technology. This approach will attune students to the lengthy history of new media and technology and the unique and recurrent debates that emerge. It will also offer students the opportunity to study and apply critical gender and racial theory approaches in a media studies context. Class assessment will draw from current approaches in digital humanities. Students will gain practice navigating web based archives for their research and using web based platforms including Slack, Medium, Canva, Soundcloud, and video sharing platforms to present their ideas and research.",

On the other hand, big cities with financial power, cultural and artistic hubs have played a significant role in shaping the film and media industries. In this course, we will explore the close relationship between urban space and the moving image to understand how their histories are interwoven with each other since the beginning of modernity. Focusing on the representations of cities like Paris, New York, Tokyo, and Berlin, we will analyze their portrayals in different forms (i.e. realistic, allegoric, futuristic, or Orientalist) and the symbolic constructions of their environment. We will also examine the conventions, styles, and clich?s of filming the city and its inhabitants from different social classes, ethnicities, (sub)cultures, and ideologies. Our course screenings will include both canonical films and alternative media texts of different genres and mediums (feature film, TV series, short documentary, and anime) covering topics such as city symphonies, noir and sci-fi cities, gender and the city, ghettos and segregation, displacement and globalization. Finally, we will discuss how new media technologies and digitalization shape our urban space and everyday life and speculate about "the future of cities" and "the next-generation metropolis."',

The course is both an introduction to some key filmmakers and national film industries, as well as an introduction to debates in film history and criticism.\n\nSome of the topics covered include: the politics of cinematic realism after World War II; decolonization and the Third Cinema movement; the emergence of "new waves" in world cinema; the underground and avant-garde filmmakers of the 1960s and 1970s; new experiments in documentary media; and the impact of digital media on cinema. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the political possibilities and limits of cinema as a medium that shapes our understanding of our social worlds.',

In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to "read" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.',

Be sure to mark down the time stamp of anything you find particularly odd, interesting or worth discussing. The small group discussions will make up a big part of this grade.\nAssignment 1: Review. Select any audio drama produced in the last five years (If you don\'t know where to start, google Radio Drama Revival or the Bello Collective to browse recent titles). Write a 3 page (double spaced) review of the show for a general audience. Your review should situate the piece in the longer history of audio drama - what connection does the show have to the history of the medium? What connections should it have? 15%\nAssignment 2: Interview. First, select a radio writer, actor or director currently working in the field and arrange to interview her / him. Write a 2-page report about how this dramatist works and what their ideas are about the strengths and weaknesses of the medium. 15%\nAssignment 3: Deconstructed Audio Drama. Final projects will be "deconstructed" audio dramas made in small groups of three. It will have four components. First, a jamboard of ideas, images and sounds that inspire the work. Second, a three to four page "treatment" for the drama, either an adaptation of an existing work, or a brand-new story. Third, some sound recordings of a few key soundscapes / sound effects for the story, along with a written explanation as to how they were made and the process that went in to them. Finally, at least one written scene that you will be prepared to both submit and act out in front of the class. All work should be submitted as a dossier on the final day of class. 40%\n\nAlternative Scheme: For MA/PhD students, you may opt to write a term paper instead of the three assignments above.',

As part of our study, we will hear from industry professionals working at the intersection of music and visual media, with a particular focus on the work of music supervision. With regards to media aesthetics, music has stimulated innovative and influential approaches to audiovisual style, modes of storytelling, and forms of media interaction. Musical genres provide a distinctive perspective on media history as well. For example, music videos helped to define the media culture of the 1980s, launched the careers of many influential directors, and have returned to prominence as music is increasingly encountered on digital screens. The film musical was an early site of media industry synergy, and the compilation soundtrack has played an important role in recent strategies of film promotion. Media texts that center on music and dance foreground the role of performing bodies, and one of our goals will be to sharpen our skills at cultural critique as we investigate the politics of representation, cultural borrowing, and discourses of authenticity in genres of musical media.",

Through CANVAS workshops and classroom discussions students will become familiar with the essential elements of well-written female characters; understand how those elements affect an audience and create the dramatic experience; and use those elements in their own work in order to create characters that resonate with an audience and themselves. The class will be structured through lectures, reading assignments, and writing assignments.\nWriting assignments are arranged to mirror a writer's creative process starting with ideas and culminating in the successful completion of an original screenplay or television pilot idea, a premise/synopsis, and the first thirty pages of your chosen script for undergraduate students and a full draft (60 page pilot or 90 page screenplay) of your script for MFA candidates.\nAbove all else, the environment will be a supportive one and students will be encouraged to participate in a community marked by an atmosphere of collaboration.",

Each student will be expected to keep an ongoing writer's journal -- ideas, doodles, dreams, notes about the script you're writing, class discussions, in-class writing exercises, etc. The journal will not be collected, but I may ask you to share your writing exercises in class or on the discussion boards.\nFormatting software:\nScripts must be formatted in an easily readable way. Final Draft is the industry standard, however you may use other formatting software.\nHighland: For those of you who don't know it, Highland is a pretty innovative and useful writing program for screenwriting/playwriting/TV writing as well as writing outlines, treatments, and novels. While Final Draft remains the industry standard, many writers prefer the Highland interface. Also worth noting that \"industry standard\" in this case really just means a long-standing habit?the only format people actually send during the development process is PDF, and Highland handles PDFs (not to mention the Final Draft format) super well.\nYou can use this link to sign up for a copy:\nHighland 2.5 Sign-Up Link / https://forms.gle/ERRcK2hXNn5BbFZG7",

While information design borrows from diverse fields like psychology, statistics, cartography, cognitive science, visual design and human machine interaction, there are a series of basic principles that make up the foundations of the field.  At the conclusion of the class, students will have a solid understanding of how to secure and prepare data for visualization, how to choose a relevant visual framework to represent that data, and how to use principles of visual design to maximize comprehension, retention and appeal of those designs.",

Students will in turn explore these themes in the production of their own video and performance-based work in response to the concepts and artists covered in class. \n\nFocusing on different artists each week, we will look at a wide variety of work ranging from traditional performance art in an institutional setting to "low-brow" projects that utilize alternative queer modes of circulation to circumvent the obstacles created by those same professionalized art channels. Students will become more familiar with this latter approach as they create, and circulate, their own work over the span of the class.

Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to "read" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.',

Write a 2-page report about how this dramatist works and what their ideas are about the strengths and weaknesses of the medium. 15%<br/><br/>\nAssignment 3: Deconstructed Audio Drama. Final projects will be "deconstructed" audio dramas made in small groups of three. It will have four components. First, a jamboard of ideas, images and sounds that inspire the work. Second, a three to four page "treatment" for the drama, either an adaptation of an existing work, or a brand-new story. Third, some sound recordings of a few key soundscapes / sound effects for the story, along with a written explanation as to how they were made and the process that went in to them. Finally, at least one written scene that you will be prepared to both submit and act out in front of the class. All work should be submitted as a dossier on the final day of class. 40%',

With regards to media aesthetics, music has stimulated innovative and influential approaches to audiovisual style, modes of storytelling, and forms of media interaction. Musical genres provide a distinctive perspective on media history as well. For example, music videos helped to define the media culture of the 1980s, launched the careers of many influential directors, and have returned to prominence as music is increasingly encountered on digital screens. The film musical was an early site of media industry synergy, and the compilation soundtrack has played an important role in recent strategies of film promotion. Media texts that center on music and dance foreground the role of performing bodies, and one of our goals will be to sharpen our skills at cultural critique as we investigate the politics of representation, cultural borrowing, and discourses of authenticity in genres of musical media.",

As new platforms, genres and mediums emerge, digital storytelling has gone from a small component of the content we consume to a major player in the ways that we view new material. As we continue to adapt to the era of digital storytelling, as creators we have to ask ourselves important questions, such as:\n\nWhat is digital storytelling?\nHow does it relate to other forms of traditional media (namely fiction, nonfiction, theatre and film making)? \nAnd what tools does it offer us as storytellers that differ from other forms of traditional media? \n\nThis course will help students to evaluate and create different types of digital storytelling. Building on the skills acquired throughout the theatre major (storytelling, creative writing, and performance), the digital storytelling class would ask undergraduates to design and create their own online stories using different types of media (e.g. video essays, podcasts, social media ?stories', etc). Students would spend the first half of the quarter looking at examples of projects that interweave digital media and theatre, and the second half of the quarter designing, writing, and creating their own projects. By the end of the quarter students will have designed, written and created their own original digital storytelling project on a subject of their choosing.",

With the shutdown of theaters worldwide during the pandemic, and the ongoing struggle for racial equity and demands for structural change within the theatre world that both predate (ChiTAC) and came to the forefront during the shutdown (We See You W.A.T.), the question becomes - how is the Chicago theatre community rebuilding itself post-shutdown? This course will explore how long-standing theatrical practices and venues have been questioned and transformed throughout the past two years.  We will investigate theatrical organizations of every size, from Broadway in Chicago to The Gift theatre (these are examples - theatres have not yet been chosen), looking to see how these organizations have adapted/are pushing forward into this new, ready to be transformed world. Will that "grit" that Chicago has been known for through the years continue to be its calling card?  Will it retain/reframe its dominance as a "theatre city?" And how will/can theatrical criticism take part in this restructuring? In this course we will attempt to tease out answers to these and other questions about theatre\'s place and function in contemporary cultural and social formations, both within the microcosm of Chicago and at large.  Students will be required to attend a show almost every week (schedule will be provided), read scripts and other related academic/journalistic material, and there will be three guest speakers. Assignments will include a review, a midterm paper and presentation, as well as a final paper.',

More specifically: What are the origins of American and international configurations of the "freak"? How did we move from "freakdom" as the embodied representation of disability and racial otherness on stage in the 19th century to the ?freak\' subcultures of the 20th and 21st century? And how has the freak been consistently used onstage, in literature, in music, and throughout pop culture as a measure of otherness and desirability? The readings for this course will span from early colonial literature\'s fascination with the myth of the native cannibal to contemporary music\'s complex relationship to representations of hyper sexual and gendered performances of the ?freak\' as both a mode of subjection and a potential site of attempted sexual liberation. This course looks to integrate interdisciplinary modes of analysis in order to form a critique of archival recovery and subjectivity, what comprises the racialized, sexualized, and gendered "freak", and how these histories of performance in the latter half of the 19th and into the 21st century were inherently and intimately connected to the shifting cultural and social landscape. The syllabus pairs historical and archival materials with contemporary interpretations, such as archival posters of Saartje Baartman alongside Suzan Lori Parks\' play Venus. The syllabus combines visual art, performance studies, theatre history, literary analysis, and other texts to enable students to take a truly interdisciplinary approach to the course material. Texts covered in class will range from TV series American Horror Story Freak Show, Tod Browning\'s film Freaks, novels such as Song of the Shank, archival materials from the 19th century, the music video for Missy Elliot\'s "Get Ur Freak On", and Deaf West Theatre\'s 2014 production of Spring Awakening. The goal of the course is to explore how race, desirability, gender, and disability are performed in popular culture.',

How, where and why do we create value? What shapes our decision-making process in making meaning both as an observer and a performer, and how can we practice awareness in these processes? The class utilizes different somatic approaches to movement awareness: Bartenieff Fundamental patterns, Authentic Movement, Feldenkrais, yoga and meditation to awaken the senses to the present moment, the liminal potential in the space between action and reaction. This emergent awareness is then explored in various modalities of performance practice: scored and free movement improvisation, Lisa Nelson's Tuning Scores, Nancy Stark Smith's Underscore, contact improvisation, and others.",

However, and as acknowledged by several scholars, including the Nobel Prize-winning Toni Morrison, race and particularly Blackness has always been inextricable from American Gothic literature. This course will consider Morrison\'s claim to explore some early canonical gothic texts by Edgar Allan Poe and Kate Chopin as a foil for how Black authors and artists take up issues of haunting, monstrosity, and corporeal threat since the nineteenth century.\n\nWhile we will spend a little time with white American authors, the center of this class is the production by Black artists. We will begin with the American "slave narrative," stories by fugitive and formerly enslaved Black people. Also, we will look at nineteenth-century gothic fiction and poetry by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Pauline E. Hopkins, Adah Isaacs Menken, W.E.B. DuBois, and Charles Chesnutt. We will also read some twentieth-century gothic texts by Toni Morrison, Tananarive Due, and others. Finally, we will reach outside of the US and look at work by Caribbean and South African writers. The class will also include film, music, and visual art. The core questions of this freshman seminar will include: how the gothic genre succeeds and fails for Black artists; the connections between race, slavery/apartheid, and the gothic; and the relationships between memory, history, and horror in the US and Caribbean.\n\nCome to class ready to enthusiastically discuss myriad issues concerning race, gender, class, and sexuality.',

It explores the rise and fall of the regime known as racial slavery coupled with the expansion of transatlantic European empires. Slavery, colonialism, and the violent production of racial difference in and across these imperial economies formed an African diaspora that resisted these conditions of exploitation and unfreedom. Framing the period as a 400-year war for abolition, we show that Black resistance led by rebels, maroons, and organized people, set into motion a wave of abolitionism that began in the 1780s, ignited Civil War in the U.S., and concluded in the 1880s when Cuba and Brazil outlawed slavery.",

Whiteness, whether it occurs under the heading of white supremacy, white privilege or white authority is the meaning that defines just the way things are, a normal state of affairs, like in the phrase, ?getting back to normal'. However, of the various populations, groups, communities, ethnicities, nationalities and identities western scholarship in the humanities and social sciences has deemed worthy of legitimate study, it remains the case that whiteness as it shapes and affects both white populations and non-white populations is routinely exempted from analysis. All of which raises the question of how and why this particular white elephant in the nation's room has remained unstudied and understudied for so long, so much so that many white individuals appear to be oblivious to the racial issues of whiteness and their own whiteness, until they encounter people of color. At the same time people of color find so much of their lives involve protracted and difficult encounters and negotiations with institutional and individual forms of racially discriminatory whiteness, that simply cannot be ignored. This course will examine whiteness in four main ways: as the racialization of white populations; as the formation of white supremacy; as the cultural institution of the White Gaze; and as the regime of White Democracy.",

On a global scale, Western societies have historically been largely responsible for developing economic institutions, religious identities, international laws and nation-states mobilized through ?race' and socially shaped by racism. Yet at the same time, western cultures have globally represented themselves as exemplars of liberalism, democracy, civilization and universalism as if these ideals and institutions were devoid of race and racism. \n\nThe objective of the course is to help students develop an effective conceptual and historical understanding of the formative processes and discourses involved in constructing western modernity as a series of racialized polities, cultures and societies. Consequently, this course is not overly concerned with empirical case studies or attitudinal assessments; it promotes a conceptual approach rather than a descriptive one. It will be concerned with explaining the apparent racial discrepancies sand racial injustices of western modernity (e.g. democracies combined with racism, liberalism combined with imperialism) and how those racial discrepancies and racial injustices inform, shape and define western societies like the United States.",

Drawing upon foundational and newer works in the field, we will explore how the construction of these categories, rooted in biological essentialism, has had immense consequences for the enslaved and her descendants, indigenous peoples, other people of color, and women, queer, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of "gender" and "sexuality" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and "religio-racial race making" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people?both within and beyond religious institutions?have resisted and challenged their centrality.',

This course will be one that concerns, indeed, black genders and sexualities; black genders, which might be to say gender\'s fracture and interrogation; black sexualities, which might be to say a questioning of where sexuality is and cannot be located. This course is, in short, the onset?a continued onset?of a reckoning with what genders and sexualities are and mean, in the context of blackness and outside of or adjacent to that context, and how we might undermine, critique, interrogate, depart from, move within, or imagine outside of entirely these categorizations that are ultimately, as this course will show, regimes of whiteness, normativity, and hegemony.',

He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That\'s the Chicago way." In this class, we will examine "the Chicago way" from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city..',

In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012.\n\nThis class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952 the first year TV advertising began to have an impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the "YouTube" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense "ground game" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages, and finding a willing press that was, at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.',

The first two goals are meant to help you achieve the third goal, which is to help you become more critical consumers of both campaigns and the media.

Beyond being constantly faced with images of our closest living relatives, however, our lives are substantially influenced by our similarities with other primates and how they are interpreted. Whether or not we think of humans as 'just another primate' or as completely unique among the primates can shape our conception of ourselves and our societies. It can also shape our attitudes toward primate research, conservation, and beyond. In this course we will explore perspectives on human-primate similarities and how they influence our understanding of human aggression, xenophobia, gender roles, sexual behavior, and more. Using writing and discussion, we will also explore how unique humans really are compared to other primates. At the end of this course you will have an appreciation for primate diversity and the complex history of primate research. You will be able to describe how different humans really are from other primates, and you will be able to pinpoint how primate research and perspectives on primates influence your daily life. Most importantly, you will be able to explain how science has broad social ramifications.",

Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by research on communities\' engagements with contemporary environmental issues.  Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we\'ll see in this course, the proliferation of "new ecologies" (as opposed to "new environmentalisms") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies.\nThis course is divided into two parts.  Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology.  We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and post-humanist ecology.  Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption patterns, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and environmental justice.',

Critical cartography refers to an assemblage of theoretical and methodological approaches, drawn from feminist, indigenous and black geographies, that consider how space and its representation have been used to reinforce or challenge social, economic and political inequalities including but not limited to racialization, displacement, and erasure.  Given these topics, it is no surprise then that techniques including countermapping and participatory GIS have found a ready audience amongst scholars working in contemporary and colonial contexts where the spatial ambitions of the powerful are often asserted through texts, while challenges to those claims can be ascertained through material and historical records. In this course we will focus on the work of scholars mapping critical cartographies in both explicit and implicit ways. While this course will pay special attention the contemporary and relatively recent pasts, examples will also draw on ancient and less familiar contexts.",

In this class, you will learn about the attributes of pre-modern urbanism in the Americas.\n\nWe will begin this course by studying the earliest experiments with settlement nucleation in the world. Then, we will review scholarship on ancient cities in North, Central, and South America. Topics will include urban configurations, everyday life in ancient cities, how inequality was built into urban space, providing for city dwellers, population and migration in cities, urban institutions, and cosmology. We will discuss the characteristics of ancient Indigenous cities such as Cahokia in Illinois, Tenochtitlan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala, and Machu Pichu in Peru, among others.

The course will begin with an introduction to questions of violence, memory, the politics of history, place, landscape, and monuments. It will continue by examining a variety of case studies from different geographical areas. The various examples and contexts will exemplify these themes of how violent pasts and the spaces and objects associated with them become sites of political contestation in the present. The class will then focus particularly on the example of Turkey as a case study through which to approach questions of memory, place, and histories of state violence against minority groups. We will examine in depth the case of the violent transformation of the Ottoman Empire into the contemporary Republic of Turkey with a focus on the 1915 Genocide of Ottoman Armenians and the ongoing war between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority, in the context of a long history of state violence against minority communities. Throughout the course students will engage with various and competing narratives of histories of violence, including state denial, memories of survivors, and attempts to resurrect the memories of repressed events. Students will engage with theoretical debates relating to memory, state violence, materiality, and space and place, and will design an individual research project relating to the themes of the course.",

(3) What are the similarities and differences between the "Jewish Question" and the "Muslim Problem"?

At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.',

In addition, we will analyze medical practices as cultural systems, as well as the ways in which health, body, and mind are socially and politically constructed and manipulated, bodies are controlled and policed, and definitions of mind and mental processes influence and are influenced by social context.  There will be a particular focus on the concepts of embodiment and trauma and their various uses and meanings in specific contexts. We will combine an examination of current theoretical paradigms with ethnographic case material from a number of societies, including Brazil, Japan, the US, and Canada.

The course material is based on interesting content that allows students to explore and compare in the foreign language broader cultural, social, and political issues. Moving away from a traditional textbook based model to a content-based course, it incorporates authentic texts and literary sources as well as external voices into classes through Video, Skype or Zoom. The authentic texts and literary sources are accompanied by creative language learning exercises designed to help students to function across different registers and genres.

Students will recognize the difference between the two language varieties and their purposes where MSA is  used mainly for writing and formal (e.g. presidential decrees) and religious settings (sermons) while the Egyptian dialect is everyday language of communication.\n5. to summarize and present key details of historical and current news events in your own words (written and oral) including voicing critical remarks.",

We will begin in the present, looking first at the impact of globalization on the conditions underlying art's production, exhibition and reception. We will then return to the late 1950s and the center of the international art world at the time, New York, and examine how the traditions of painting and sculpture, and with them the idea of a modernist canon, were increasingly challenged by a range of practices (dispersed geographically and otherwise) that have been loosely labeled as neo-dada, pop, minimalism and conceptual art. The second half of the course will focus on the issues raised by the return to representation in painting, by photography and other technologies of reproduction, and by new genres like video art and installation. Even more recent paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. Along with the social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes, we will track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and will question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream.

French artists were active players in the city\'s numerous crises and transformations between 1848-1900, which included utopian popular revolutions, foreign occupation, and massive urban reconstruction projects. Nineteenth-century Paris was also the capital of an empire that stretched from North and West Africa to the Caribbean and Polynesia. The foreign bodies and objects that filled the city as a result of these imperial circumstances left an indelible mark on French art. \n\nThis course explores art in Paris at the intersection of modern politics, colonialism, and capitalist industrialization. In addition to avant-garde painting movements such as Impressionism and its "post-Impressionist" challengers, we also examine Orientalism and Primitivism alongside academic sculpture, universal exhibitions, and reproductive technologies like photography and the illustrated press. Some of the artists we examine include Gustave Courbet, Honor? Daumier, Rosa Bonheur, Nadar, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, ?douard Manet, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, Gustave Moreau, Jean-L?on G?r?me, Henri Matisse, and Paul Gauguin.',

However, twenty six years later, not only has the promissory view of democratic possibility lost its transformative charm, the phrase itself that once encapsulated our cultural futurity has also lost its discursive sway. But in what ways could the envisioned new artistic sensibility captured by phrase, South African cultural expression, help address and practicalise the liberatory as well as conciliatory promises attributed to democracy? What is South Africa? Who are South Africans? This course retrospectively explores the complexities and debates that surround the early 1990s cultural discourses in the unfoldment of democratic dispensation.',

This course engages the historical unfolding of the aesthetics of resistance and protest in the South African cultural landscape, with particular attention being given to visual arts.

In fact, many of the objects that comprise this canon are oftentimes not "objects" at all. Taking a decolonial approach to study the canon of Non-Western art, this course addresses the animacies and ontologies of different categories of "objects" in museum collections, including materially-embodied deities such as Katsina dolls (Hopi) and Orishas (Yoruba diaspora); ancestors that take form as seeds (Pueblo) and ceramics (Mimbres), and materials such as feathers (Aztec, Tupinamba, Hawaiian) and pipestone (Lakota, Dakota and Yankton Sioux) that mediate different realms of existence. The class will also consider the remains of humans, plants, and animals housed in anthropology and natural history museums. The question of objecthood also applies to people conceptualized as property, sold as commodities and displayed within ethnographic and World\'s Fair contexts as well as the land upon which museums are built. We will learn about some of the ways that these "objects" entered into museums as we compare the Western epistemologies by which they are organized there to the indigenous ontologies they occupy within their cultures of origin.',

This ontological connection between sculpture and (white) marble only strengthened over the course of the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries, at the same that the discipline of Art History came into fruition. Why does this history associate marble exclusively with whiteness, despite the material's many valuable polychrome varieties? Why does this history treat this whiteness as the absence of color, rather than a color with its own host of political, cultural, and racial associations? What are the sculptural implications for other materials, notably porcelain, sugar, and bronze? This course attempts to answer these questions, among others, by tracing the parallel and interwoven histories of eighteenth-century ideas of racial difference and white marble's rise to prominence within the field of Art History. \n\nStudents are encouraged to write seminar papers on the political and racial valences of color and materials in art and art historiography across cultural traditions, time periods, and media.",

This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the "normal." Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine. No prior knowledge of Korean culture or language are required to take this course. Students are expected to actively participate in class and work in groups on collaborative projects.

In the course of this exploration, we seek to challenge our presuppositions about a seemingly simple question: what is \"the body,\" and how do we know? We open by considering themes of dying and the afterlife, food and drink, health and medicine, gender and family. We then turn to Daoist traditions of visual culture that envision the human body as intimately connected with the cosmos and picture the body's interior as a miniature landscape populated by a pantheon of gods. We read ghost stories and analyze the complex history of footbinding. Finally, we conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter, we investigate how the body has mediated relationships between Buddhist, Daoist, and popular religious traditions. By the course's end, students will gain key resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

          desc: 'AY21-22 When asked in 1985 why he writes "economic novels" (keizai sh?setsu), the popular novelist Kajiyama Toshiyuki responded: "Why should we limit our literary subjects to love affairs and things like that? There\'s romance in money: people are living in the much muddier swamp of capitalism." By making this "muddy swamp" of capitalism legible for a wide range of audiences, the economic novel has become one of the most popular literary genres in postwar Japan. Since their inception in the late 1950s, economic novels have sold as well as, if not better, than mysteries and twice as well as the more high-brow form of "pure literature" (jun bungaku). Centering on the economic realities of life under capitalism, economic novels portray the workings of financial corruption, the mechanics of production and distribution, and the experience of laboring within one of the largest consumer economies in the world. This course traces this genre from its origins in 1957 to the contemporary moment. Reading works by early practitioners of the form to its more recent inflections in the literature of writers like Oyamada Hiroko (The Factory), Tsumuro Kikuko (There\'s No Such Thing as an Easy Job), and Murata Sayaka (Convenience Store Woman), we will examine the relationship between literature and the transformations in Japan\'s capitalist economy. We will consider, among other topics, how this genre depicts changes in the workplace and forms of labor, systemic modes of economic exploitation, the psychological and emotional experience of debt in a financialized economy, and the gendering of particular types of work. Guiding our inquiry will be an overarching question: what are the connections between literary and economic form?',

The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

Tech industry billionaires tout Buddhist mindfulness techniques at the annual Wisdom 2.0 conference, and Google offers mindfulness training courses taught by a Zen abbot. Mindfulness is also being presented as a panacea for those suffering from physical and mental pain, readily available in American hospital settings and psychological counseling services. Buddha images too can be found far from Buddhist temples?at the hip restaurant Buddha-Bar located in many cities around the world one can sip cocktails and dine before a massive Buddha statue while listening to lounge music. And in the Chicago area, one encounters Buddha head sculptures positioned on the ground in parks, by roads, and even in public school playgrounds as part of the Ten Thousand Ripples art project. How, and why, did aspects of Buddhism enter all of these different social locations? Why does Buddhism receive a pass more often than other religions by the "spiritual but not religious" crowd? Can Buddhism be secular? In what ways is Buddhism compatible with science, and can Buddhist practices be proven effective using scientific methods? Can paying better attention by means of Buddhist meditation practices liberate us from suffering caused by digital distraction? In what ways can Buddhist articulations of interdependence, no self, and compassion be resources for addressing racial and structural injustice, even as sexual abuse, racism, and trans/homophobia continue to traumatize members of some Buddhist communities? These are some of the many questions we will consider through readings by some of the most creative Buddhist leaders, critics, and consumers of our time.',

We will also\nlook at administrative documents (gzhung yig), other manuscripts and scrolls to become\nfamiliar with the most common forms of Tibetan calligraphy.

Du Bois\'s proclamation that the "color line [is] the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea" as a cue, this graduate seminar examines and engages Afro-Asian critique as a way to interrogate the world-systems of race, caste, and colorism as they are routed through, and inform the political landscapes, of the U.S. and South Asia. By underscoring the limits and possibilities of disciplinarity, the seminar explores the ways the overlapping histories of Blacks and South Asians necessitate new modes of critical analysis, knowledge production, and artistic creation to imagine alternative socialities. As such, course material will cover works ranging from the rhetoric and speeches (of B. R. Ambedkar and Martin Luther King), aesthetic statements on color (Perumal Murugan and Zora Neal Hurston), political manifestos (the Black Panther Party and the Dalit Panthers), as well as art (A/Nil and Casteless Collective).',

It was often argued that people of different races and different genders were fundamentally different, and as such their roles in society should differ as well. Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person's abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place?\n\nIn this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender. We will identify key scientific studies and their subsequent legacy to reveal the precarious nature of scientific interpretation in the hands of biased individuals. We will discuss how power structures can infiltrate scientific integrity and propose safeguards to prevent this kind of infiltration in the future.",

As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors. \n\nThe full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of: \n\nInstrumental analysis; \nSynthesis of inorganic compounds; \nSynthesis of organic compounds; \nSpectroscopy. \n\nThe course is designed for you to work in a "research environment". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. \n\nCHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements. In addition, you will be asked to design and carry out a 4-week research project at the end of the quarter based on some aspect of course material in the entire Chem 350-1,2,3 sequence.',

It features two weeks of classroom-based instruction on experimental design, data handling, and analysis; supplemented by NIH Rigor And Reproducibility Training Modules. This overview will be followed by a combination of lectures and labs addressing a broad range of analytical techniques and imaging methods. These lessons will then be applied to inquiry-based learning in Northwestern's advanced centers and instrumentation cores. \n\nIn addition to lecture, students are expected to devise two Mini-Research Projects and will work on one with senior research staff to apply specific protocols utilizing instrumentation available within Research Cores and University Centers. Students will design specific experiments in selected areas of their research interest, and learn new sample preparation methods and instrumentation within one of the following areas: genomics, proteomics, in vivo and molecular imaging, small molecule synthesis and purification; high-throughput screening, structural biology (x-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM), analysis of bioelements. \n\nMaterial generated in the class counts for course credit will be usable in the students' research group settings.",

In addition to this chronological narrative, the course will treat several key themes and concepts in Roman culture. The Roman military will receive attention, as will gender relations and public spectacles. Roman religion and the role of slavery will also be discussed.",

In this course we will discuss the place of the Amazons in ancient literature, in various artistic traditions, and in relation to cultures on the periphery of the Greek world where the idea of female warriors did not seem so impossible. Specific topics for this course include, Amazons at Troy, the "romance" of Achilles and Penthesilea, the Amazonomachy on Greek temples, cross-dressing in the myth of Heracles and Omphale, sons of Amazons, "historical" Amazons, and the modern afterlife of the Amazons.',

Since their rediscovery in the early modern period, directors, translators, and adaptors have repeatedly turned to the poetry of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to reflect on political, ethical, social, and theological issues of their time. More recently, the plays have proved fertile ground for directors eager to imagine alternative ways of thinking about race, gender, and class. In this course, we will read a selection of Athenian tragedies, with special emphasis on their form, ancient performance context, and themes, as well as select examples of their contemporary reception for diverse audiences. All readings will be in translation, and students will be encouraged to work in groups to perform and develop creative responses to individual scenes.",

This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the "normal." Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine. No prior knowledge of Korean culture or language are required to take this course. Students are expected to actively participate in class and work in groups on collaborative projects.

Since their rediscovery in the early modern period, directors, translators, and adaptors have repeatedly turned to the poetry of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to reflect on political, ethical, social, and theological issues of their time. More recently, the plays have proved fertile ground for directors eager to imagine alternative ways of thinking about race, gender, and class. In this course, we will read a selection of Athenian tragedies, with special emphasis on their form, ancient performance context, and themes, as well as select examples of their contemporary reception for diverse audiences. All readings will be in translation, and students will be encouraged to work in groups to perform and develop creative responses to individual scenes.",

Considering this, it seemsvery remarkable that at a closer look, figurations of Jesus abound inJewish literature. In the seminar we will concentrate on the realm ofGerman language texts from the 18th century to the present dealingwith Jesus or related symbols like the cross or scenes of the Passionand Crucifixion. Not surprisingly, in Christian as well as Jewishcontexts mixing religious symbolism in literature and art repeatedlyprovoked scandals. Authors like Carl Einstein were fined forblaspheming Christ, while others like Stefan Zweig, Alfred D?blin orFranz Werfel were accused of having betrayed Judaism.\nOne hypothesis concerning this corpus of texts is that by adoptingcentral narratives and images of the Christian majority society theyclaim Jewish participation and explore its limits. By focusing onJesus as a Jew many of these texts rewrite and transform dominantChristian perspectives and expose their inherent violence. If theypresent the martyred Jesus explicitly as a Jew e.g., connections topersecutions, pogroms and genocide are evoked. At the same time,questions concerning a shared history and modes of respect despitedifference are raised. We will discuss how texts problematizeassimilation and also try to understand the role of (trans-)figurationsof Jesus in 20th Jewish literature about war, the Shoah and themodes of memory.",

There\'s romance in money: people are living in the much muddier swamp of capitalism." By making this "muddy swamp" of capitalism legible for a wide range of audiences, the economic novel has become one of the most popular literary genres in postwar Japan. Since their inception in the late 1950s, economic novels have sold as well as, if not better, than mysteries and twice as well as the more high-brow form of "pure literature" (jun bungaku). Centering on the economic realities of life under capitalism, economic novels portray the workings of financial corruption, the mechanics of production and distribution, and the experience of laboring within one of the largest consumer economies in the world. This course traces this genre from its origins in 1957 to the contemporary moment. Reading works by early practitioners of the form to its more recent inflections in the literature of writers like Oyamada Hiroko (The Factory), Tsumuro Kikuko (There\'s No Such Thing as an Easy Job), and Murata Sayaka (Convenience Store Woman), we will examine the relationship between literature and the transformations in Japan\'s capitalist economy. We will consider, among other topics, how this genre depicts changes in the workplace and forms of labor, systemic modes of economic exploitation, the psychological and emotional experience of debt in a financialized economy, and the gendering of particular types of work. Guiding our inquiry will be an overarching question: what are the connections between literary and economic form?',

In the middle decades of the 20th century, radio plays were among the most popular forms of fiction in many parts of the world. Legends have come down about thrillers of the 1930s, but these remain framed inside narratives of nostalgia, and are not representative of the broad work of experimental writers in the medium. In this class, you will learn how radio dramas were made in three historical periods: classic American (1937-54); mid-century British (1954-1974) and contemporary podcast traditions, with additional focus on audio dramas in the global south, including South Africa and India. We will explore the cultural and political background of each of these contexts, practice how to "read" a radio play, and ask about how the form interacts with various media, and expressive agendas.',

Select any audio drama produced in the last five years (If you don\'t know where to start, google Radio Drama Revival or the Bello Collective to browse recent titles). Write a 3 page (double spaced) review of the show for a general audience. Your review should situate the piece in the longer history of audio drama - what connection does the show have to the history of the medium? What connections should it have? 15%\nAssignment 2: Interview. First, select a radio writer, actor or director currently working in the field and arrange to interview her / him. Write a 2-page report about how this dramatist works and what their ideas are about the strengths and weaknesses of the medium. 15%\nAssignment 3: Deconstructed Audio Drama. Final projects will be "deconstructed" audio dramas made in small groups of three. It will have four components. First, a jamboard of ideas, images and sounds that inspire the work. Second, a three to four page "treatment" for the drama, either an adaptation of an existing work, or a brand-new story. Third, some sound recordings of a few key soundscapes / sound effects for the story, along with a written explanation as to how they were made and the process that went in to them. Finally, at least one written scene that you will be prepared to both submit and act out in front of the class.

The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

To complicate things further, all of these beings are in constant movement, often revealing themselves to be different from what they initially were taken to be. But what they all have in common is a very special and difficult-to-define relationship to the narrative in and through which they appear. This course seeks to focus specifically on the relation between the narrative and the "animals" and quasi-animals that are often its subject. Ultimately it seeks to pose the question of the role of the reader and of reading in relating to what seems both irreducibly strange and yet uncannily familiar - what we call "animals".',

Shortly after his arrival, he published Being For Myself Alone: Origins of Jewish Autobiography (2005), which won a Koret Foundation Jewish Studies Publication Program prize. The book investigates the development of autobiography among the Jews in Eastern Europe from the 19th century to the period just around World War I, focusing on works written in Hebrew, but also considering Yiddish and German works, as well as the interaction among these languages of Jewish expression in this period. He is now working on his next book, From People of the Book to Literary Nation: On the Emergence of Literature in Jewish Eastern Europe. In exploring the cultural, social and ideological ramifications of the painful transition experienced by the secular, or secularizing, sector of East European Jewry, Moseley is seeking to shed light on how Jewish writers and (even more importantly) readers began to construct modern Jewish identity. He has close links with the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, where he worked as an Assistant Archivist from 1987-91, and then initiated a project to prepare an English language anthology of the interwar youth autobiography collections housed in the YIVO Archives, for which he received a major grant from the National Endowment of Humanities. He chaired the editorial committee and wrote the introduction for the resulting volume, Awakening Lives: Autobiographies of Jewish Youth in Poland before the Holocaust (2002).",

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power, and vulnerability.  How have literature, psychoanalysis and philosophy responded to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness?  To what extent does seduction affirm an inequitable logic when it comes to age, gender, and race?  Does seduction always imply violence?  How can we define the notion of consent, and can it offer not only legal redress but ethical care?  To what extent can justice regulate sex, fantasies, and desires?  To what extent has psychoanalysis problematically altered our notions of guilt and innocence when it comes to seduction?  Throughout this seminar, we aim to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction and consent in a broad range of literary, psychoanalytical, legal, and philosophical texts from Europe and the USA.

We start by reviewing under what situation is the government provision desirable. We then study how levels of state goods and services are determined, and what are the main sources of revenues through which these expenditures are financed, including taxes and transfers from higher levels of government. Students will also learn the importance of political considerations and the role of state and local politics in influencing local government decisions. The course will end with policy analysis and applications. The main focus is going to be on the United States but we are also going to explore examples and issues faced by local governments around the world.",

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through price discrimination, resale price maintenance, entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law. Throughout the course we will explore the general topic of regulation and industry cases, both current and historical.",

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.

We will also discuss the methods (and shortcomings of these methods) used by economists and policymakers to place dollar values on environmental amenities (since such valuations will determine what policy options are deemed "efficient"), such as benefit-cost analysis. Then we will apply these tools to look at a particular set of environmental problems caused by negative externalities transmitted through naturally occurring amenities, and the effects of the policies we construct in response to these problems.

Readings include Hobbes's Leviathan, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal, poems by Dorothy Parker, performances by Reggie Watts, and Alison Bechdel's Dykes to Watch Out For.

Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social "ills," and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. Focusing on the 18th and 19th centuries, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness, health, and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men? How do these tropes change over time? What happens if health, rather than illness, becomes a primary marker of virtue? And what does all of this mean for us today? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary "wellness culture"?or even contemporary feminism?',

Is there a mood, feeling, or affect readily identifiable as \"The '90s,\" and what social transformations does this mood express? In the 1990s, Francis Fukuyama announced the end of history, Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, sang \"my loneliness is killing me,\" and the MTV generation emerged as a self-styled generation of slackers. Even as Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize and the Whitney Biennial became the most diverse exhibit by a major American museum, Operation Gatekeeper militarized the US-Mexico border and the Los Angeles riots brought widespread attention to anti-Black violence. This course will read deeply and diversely across the period, with an emphasis on African American, Asian American, and Latinx literature, in order to grapple with the contradictions between ostensible cultural tolerance, the explosion of consumerism, and the persistence of structural and economic inequality. Working together, we will produce our own account of recent history, as it affects us. We will ask: What does it mean to say that a decade feels a certain way? How did narratives about race, class, gender, and nation converge and diverge? Were the '90s just the '70s all over again? Possible authors and primary texts include Clueless, Karen Tei Yamashita, Nirvana, Percival Everett, Paul Beatty, Seinfeld, Pavement, Harryette Mullen, Ernesto Quio?ez, Slacker, Sex and the City.",

How have prior generations thought about the possibilities of telling their life stories?  What have been the stakes in doing so?  Who were the imagined readers of these texts, and what happens when they're read in contexts and by people that the original authors could hardly have imagined?including all of us now in the twenty-first century.\n\nOur reading will include autobiographical works by Mary Rowlandson, a Puritan woman captured by Native Americans who wrote about her experiences; founding father Benjamin Franklin; Frederick Douglass, the formerly enslaved person turned brilliant abolitionist leader; William Apess, author of the first autobiography by a Native American; and the great gay poet Walt Whitman, who invented a wholly new kind of poetry to tell his story.

In this writing composition class, we will consider how the handcrafted shapes our relationship with the material world. We will think about how handmade items materialize embodied knowledge practices (like the baker who intuitively knows when the dough just right), how the label "handmade" influences our spending habits (aren\'t we tempted to pay just a little bit more for something that was made by hand?), and how handcrafted objects produce affective attachments (like the items we hold onto because they were made by someone close to us). Handmade objects tell us stories about who made them and, often, these stories influence how we perceive and value these objects. Moreover, practices of making by hand have a long history. How have our relationships to handmade objects and labor changed since the rise of mass manufacturing? What does the popularity of DIY projects say about our connection to making by hand? What are the ethical stakes of fetishizing the handcrafted? These are some of the questions we will investigate through a variety of genres, including novels, essays, articles, and poetry. Writing, too, is a craft. As we read these texts, we will consider the style, organization, and argumentation strategies of different writers, evaluating the effectiveness of these approaches through revision-based writing assignments. We will also hone critical reading and research skills, culminating in a research project on a topic that interests you related to processes of making by hand.',

What patterns govern the conversations we have, and how do we create social relationships, communities, and identities in those conversations? Why do some people mix multiple languages when they speak and write? Is it, like, ok for me to, like, use like so much? What about um or ain\'t or ya know? Students will formulate and consider their own questions about language and social life in papers and presentations.',

How do the tragedy and the triumph of the Civil War inflect American poetry and narrative? And how do post-bellum writers represent the complexities of democracy, particularly the gains and losses of Reconstruction, the advent of and resistance to the "New Woman," and the class struggle in the newly reunited nation?',

We will also question the category of Latinx. How do the experiences and histories of the various groups described under that label benefit from and/or resist identification as a single ethnicity? Most importantly, we will ask what poetry, memoirs, and novels have to offer as a way of understanding Latinx experiences. By the end of the quarter students will have an overview of the heterogeneous literary voices and aesthetics that constitute US Latinx literature.",

Eng 282 applies strategies for effective business communication to real-life problems, and asks you to reflect on who you are as a business professional and colleague along the way. This quarter we will work together as a class, in small teams, and individually on learning how to formulate communication strategies for any number of situations and scenarios that pop up in our professional lives. As we do so, you will continually reflect on who you are as a business professional, and on how you wish to develop as a communicator as you work toward your chosen career.',

In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for crucial questions that literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity.  Beginning with classical mythology and the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of possession, including William Shakespeare's Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudon (1952), the story of a famous reported demonic possession at a French convent.  We will go on to study the possessions and hauntings staged in Edgar Allen Poe's short stories and Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying what it means to be denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987), James Baldwin's essays, and Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard (2008).  These texts invite analysis of the dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of a narrative. \n\nThroughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on different literary genres.

What do human representations of polar spaces tell us?south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic?about our relationship to space, environment, and climate? In this course, we will explore the most prominent of Polar genres, the travel narrative, to better understand how these places shape, and are shaped by, our political, aesthetic, and ethical understanding. Examining the sublime appeal of icy solitude figured in Romantic poetry and modern science fiction, working with archival materials of failed Victorian expeditions, and reading Inuit novels memorializing ways of life threatened by outside intrusions, we will consider the power of various narrative mediums and technologies to cultivate care for the distant, the invisible, and the potentially catastrophic. By investigating how our cultural conceptions of ice have evolved over time, we will come to appreciate how narrative is turned to, time and again, to render the far away nearby, as well as learn how we might more effectively take up narrative now as these climes face crisis.",

These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the French-speaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in positions of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the Conqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became beef and pork and mutton - at least when they were served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other words associated with aristocratic life, these terms all derive from French. In this course we will investigate this and many other milestones in the history of the English language, focusing on the period from the early middle ages through the eighteenth century. We will pay particular attention to the relationships among "high" and "low" forms of language, including efforts to elevate the status of English and the dynamics of self-consciously "low" registers of language such as slang and obscenity. In addition to offering an introduction to the linguistic, literary, and social history of England, this course will help you to develop a more sensitive understanding of modern English that you can bring to other classes and to life in general.',

          desc: "Much of writing is made up of obsessions. We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer's life, said it simply: \"You have to be obsessed. It's not something you'd want to be?it's rather something you couldn't help but be.\" In this course we'll explore \"obsession\" from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we'll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to?from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind's eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we'll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.\n\nStudents will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story. This class is for serious writers who are unafraid of taking real risks, unafraid of true rewrites/revisions, unafraid of working hard toward turning a good story or an essay into a great one.",

Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience.   Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales:  How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife?   We will be reading Chaucer's poem in the original Middle English.  At the end of the quarter, we will give an in-class performance of one of the tales.",

We will approach these plays from literary, theatrical, and book-history perspectives; please be prepared to think across these categories.  We\'ll read: a revenge tragedy more popular in its time than Hamlet; a history play about a king and his lower-class, immigrant boyfriend; a tragicomedy and a tragedy about incestuous siblings (one a shocking rewrite of Romeo and Juliet); two very different tragedies with women at their center (one the first original play by an English woman); a marriage anti-comedy with multiple trans* resonances; and a prematurely postmodern play where the audience seizes control of the script.  These plays will help us think about theatrical genres, about the conditions of writing, performance, and printing, about modes of social organization (marriage, family, sexuality, reproduction, social class, race and ethnicity, monarchy, dynasty, nation, to name a few), about periodization ("Renaissance" or "early modern"?), and about canonicity (for example, the distinction between Shakespeare and "his contemporaries" implied by our curriculum and in the first sentence of this course description).',

This course will consider the development of the Gothic genre in the eighteenth century and Romantic period as a revealing glimpse into the period's anxieties regarding humankind's place in the natural world, largely by way of the supernatural forces writers conjured to make sense of their fears of the changing landscape. In turn, we will consider how Gothic tropes?including the monstrous, the uncanny, and the sublime?shape current ecological discourses around the Anthropocene and climate catastrophe. By reading some of the genre's most (in)famous writers, including Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, and Emily Bronte, we will examine how the Gothic affords a distinctly ecological perspective on questions of sexuality, nationality, xenophobia, and otherness in Britain and America--then and now--as well as a means for capturing the changing, and often uncanny, relationships between the human, the non-human, and the more-than-human.",

Tracing the afterlives of Bront?'s confined madwoman through twentieth-century reimaginations of the trope, including Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House, Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, and recent films such as Midsommar and Hereditary, this course will examine how insanity has been seen as a category useful for regaining (and sometimes blocking) political and literary agency. Putting these texts and films in dialogue with critical responses by Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and others, we will explore the knotty question of how madness shapes our culture's narratives about gender and authority.",

"Representation" is a tricky word in politics and media: queer communities, communities of color, and disabled communities (and those categories overlap in important ways) have pushed for more representation in film, television, the music industry, and publishing. Lesbian women have long complained of the community\'s invisibility. At the same time, minoritized communities must grapple with the fact that simple representation can be a mixed bag. If the primary goal is visibility, is all representation good representation? Are lesbian villains, or lesbians who are narratively punished, still politically useful?  Does the inclusion of a lesbian character (or lesbian characters) "count" if no one involved in the production of the object was themselves a lesbian? This course will explore these questions and more, discussing theoretical readings from cultural studies alongside our primary films, television, music, and print media. We will consider the difficult and derogatory tropes that are part and parcel of lesbian representation in the media, but we will engage most intensively with narratives that have attempted to expand the narrative potential of queer female life and to affirm lesbian identities?with complex results.',

It seems the only consensus about the decade is that there isn't one, aside for the noisy kaleidoscope of disco, drugs, and killer style known to popular culture. Politically, socially, and economically, however, the Seventies is seldom discussed for itself, instead conceived as the disastrous decade clearing the stage for Eighties corporatism, Reaganism, and nostalgia. This course reads deep and diversely to study this period of time as rendered and remembered. We will read and watch materials of the period as well as contemporary texts in order to ask, Why is the Seventies so difficult to summarize? How do narratives about race, class, and nation clash and diverge? What is the mood of the time and whose mood is it? What about our current period necessitates remembering the Seventies in a certain way and how does this rewrite the sense of the time for those who lived and wrote it?

The image of a strong female lead shooting arrows, jumping off trains, and generally kicking ass, has captured the attention of readers and movie-goers, even as superhero film franchises have been slow to feature female leads. This class asks why strong heroines are popular in this cultural moment both by analyzing the novels and films that feature them, and by contextualizing them through the lens of cultural studies. We will dissect characterizations of recent popular heroines and examine how they might undermine hierarchies and norms of gender and sexuality. At the same time, our inquiry will trouble whether the current era of heroines is as subversive as it might seem. Has the recent popularity of action heroines changed the way popular culture represents the role of women and girls in society more generally? Is the heroine's journey distinct from the hero's? How might the heroine destabilize constructs of gender and sexuality? How does the role of the heroine relate to literary or movie genres? To answer these questions, our readings will engage with queer and feminist theory, masculinity studies, and film theory.",

The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry?including description, rhetoric, story and song?and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and "imitation" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of "Daily Poems," thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others\' work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.',

We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks.

What inspires poets\' "making"? What makes a poem "new"? And what roles does translation play in generating new poems and poetics as the twentieth century "turns a new page in the book of the world" and opens "a startling chapter" of "world-embracing cultures" and "hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and races" (Fenollosa)? These questions open broad reaches on the vast river of poetic traditions, materials, techniques, and experiences that poets navigated during the long, turbulent twentieth century, articulating poetic aims, theories, principles, and manifestos as they went. Baudelaire sings the painter of modern life; Yeats borrows from French Symbolism to launch the Celtic Revival; Eliot urges poets to cultivate a historical sense so as to discern what\'s new in their own moment; for William Carlos Williams, "So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens." We\'ll begin by studying highlights of this thrillingly generative moment in literary history to see how poems emerge in creative dialogue with other poems within and across historical moments, locales, languages, cultural surrounds, and sensibilities. We\'ll hone close reading, analytic, and comparative skills as we deepen our knowledge of the historical conditions that helped to shape the imaginative, formal, and linguistic virtuosity of poems-as-worlds and to enrich the resources of English poetry, from verse lines, forms, sound patterns (meter, rhythm, music, tone), diction, and figurative language to the poets\' situations, voices, addressees, and audiences. In the final weeks, working with our Humanities Bibliographer and me, students will home in on topics and design juicy, imaginative, feasible projects that combine scholarly research and literary interpretation. One for all and all for one, we\'ll learn to frame promising research questions; to navigate scholarly databases and archives; to gather and evaluate sources and think in dialogue with them; and to give and take constructive critique in crafting a sound, engaging, well-written essay.',

The poem poses numerous interpretative puzzles?the objects of the poem\'s irony, the politics of its author, and the demographics of its intended audience, to name a few?puzzles that have been "solved" in strikingly different ways at different historical moments. This course takes as its subject the Canterbury Tales and its reception history, exploring in detail both the poem and its multiple interpretative contexts. As we read the Tales, we will consider the narratives (and narrative conventions) that Chaucer transforms and the fourteenth-century voices with whom he is in dialogue. We will investigate the ways in which the tales circulated both individually and as a collection and analyze the various paratexts that accompanied them (glosses, prologues, illustrations, and "spurious" links and tales). Along with the early publication context, we will explore current critical conversation in Chaucer Studies (as well as medieval studies more broadly) and the scholarly history to which it responds, reading the Tales through the lens of critical race studies, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial studies, psychoanalysis, and old and new historicisms. In this context, we will use the Tales to ask "Why Chaucer?," taking up some of the recent controversies in medieval literary studies and the responses they have catalyzed.',

While social contract theory would soon reach new predominance (ie with Thomas Hobbes in the 17thC and rising 18thC claims about the foundational role of consent to government), what models preceded it? What claims and values justified the apparent organicism of a faith or reliance on the human body as an allegory for political authority? How do these approaches manage qualities like gender, age, or illness that might trouble the allegory?\n\nThis seminar will consider some key texts in early English political thought, beginning with the Tudor court case from which the phrase \"the body politic\" is mainly cited, and proceeding then to materials from the unsettling events of the English Reformation that address the question of obedience to the secular power (ie Thomas More's Utopia, William Tyndale's Obedience of a Christian Man, Thomas Cranmer's homilies from the first decade of the English church) and to anatomical and medical materials (like Thomas Elyot's Castel of Helthe and Helkiah Crooke's Microcosmographia). From this groundwork, we will move on consider early modern English debates about royal authority, including the ideological disarray triggered by the historical facts of a female monarch and of rebellion as treason (ie John Knox's First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, selected speeches given by Elizabeth I, James I's The Law of Free Monarchy, and John Milton's Tenure of Kings and Magistrates). To explore these dynamics in the context of theater (then the largest assemblages of people into \"bodies\"), the seminar will delve into several Shakespeare plays (from among Henry IV 1&2, Richard II, Richard III, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, and most particularly Measure for Measure) to assess the proposition that Shakespeare ? among his other forms of attention ? was also a political theorist.",

We will begin the course and introduce these literary accounts with recordings and written transcripts of selected WPA interviews of former slaves by largely white interlocutors working for the Roosevelt Administration.

Final projects will enable students to feature their own research interests in creative installations involving literary texts, historical documents, cinematic or televisual materials and artifacts from the popular culture of the 19th century.

We will then move on to discuss theories of learning as they apply to fine-arts courses. We will take into consideration intersectional challenges (race, gender, class, disability, etc). And we will think about the differences between teaching undergraduates and graduate students.\n\nIn the second half of the course we will move into the practical work of designing creative writing courses that have a beginning, middle, and end, and also a clear set of achievable learning objectives. You will do the practical work of drafting syllabi, generating exercises, and selecting reading material for introductory courses in poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction.",

Environmental anthropology became more prominent in the 1980s, and is typically characterized by research on communities\' engagements with contemporary environmental issues.  Environmental anthropology has greater commitments to advocacy, critique, and application than ecological anthropology, but as we\'ll see in this course, the proliferation of "new ecologies" (as opposed to "new environmentalisms") denotes the continued synergy between ecological and environmental anthropologies.\n\nThis course is divided into two parts.  Part I will provide an historical overview of the development of environmental anthropology.  We will cover some of the most influential research trends in the field: environmental determinism, cultural ecology, systems ecology, ethnoecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and post-humanist ecology.  Part II will then pivot to the application of environmental anthropology knowledge to some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the contemporary world: population pressure, capitalist consumption patterns, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and environmental justice.',

Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic "green" messaging versus mere corporate "greenwashing." Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the "Anthropocene" (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually "register" or "notice" on a global scale? If not, what kinds of "media interventions" do we need to be making and how? Course content will include discussion of media interventions as moral interventions, media activism for social change, eco-media responses by religious communities and organizations, participatory digital culture, and the challenges of addressing environmental crisis in the distraction economy and what has been called the "post-truth era." Students will have the opportunity to learn by doing, proposing and crafting their own environmental media interventions as the course\'s final project.

The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as well as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with discussions regarding opportunities for global translation of innovative water technologies and water-management solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. In addition, the course will host a one-day conference featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israeli water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world.\n\nThis course is taught with CIV_ENV 395-0-25 and JWSH_ST 390-0-1',

Reading leading theorists like Rob Nixon and Edward Soja side by side with Jesmyn Ward's post-Katrina novel Salvage the Bones (2011), Toni Jensen's stories about oil and fracking on Indigenous lands, and poetry by Nikky Finney and Heid E. Erdrich, this class interrogates how literature can inform our understanding of environmental injustice and different types of violence. It grounds the discussion in a longer history of colonial extraction and Indigenous dispossession, racism, structural neglect, and ongoing residential segregation by discussing Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 hurricane novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, and looking at Zitkala-?a's influential 1924 report on the settler defrauding of Osage Indians for their oil-rich lands.\n\nThis course is taught with ENGLISH 378-0-21",

In The Untouchables, Sean Connery tells Kevin Costner, "You want to get Capone? Here\'s how you get Capone. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That\'s the Chicago way." In this class, we will examine "the Chicago way" from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city.\n\nThis course is taught with ENGLISH 378-0-22 and AMER_ST 310-0-10',

Coetzee, Abulrazak Gurnah, and Ngugi wa Thiong\'o), fiction and poetry by important but neglected authors (e.g., Saida Hagi-Dirie Herzi and Henry ole Kulet), and works by emergent writers who deploy animality as a trope to explore the relationship between the human and the non-human.  Subtopics will include ecology, biopolitics, slavery, race, diaspora, intra-African immigration, science fiction, queerness, and ubuntu.

Whose world ends in "end of the world" narratives? This course invites students to read and watch South Korean and diasporic narratives centered around disasters, both real and fictional, to engage questions of politics, representation, and inequalities that shape disaster narratives. Ranging from disasters of the past to more contemporary ones such as pandemics and Sewol ferry, the disasters examined in this course have sparked complex conversations surrounding a more just society and the doomed end of the "normal."   Engaging scholarship on disasters, speculative fictions, critical race theory, and gender studies, the course introduces students to the varied academic and cultural responses to disasters and the underlying stakes that drive these responses. Students will be assigned a variety of texts to analyze, such as film, novels, webtoons, and news, as well as choosing a disaster narrative of their own interest to examine. No prior knowledge of Korean culture or language are required to take this course. Students are expected to actively participate in class and work in groups on collaborative projects. Assignments will consist of short essays and a creative final project.\n\nThis course is taught with ASIAN_LC 240-0-20 and COMP_LIT 202-0-20',

What did it take to uproot centuries of tradition, cultural values, social hierarchy, and the established political order France shared with the rest of Europe, virtually overnight? In this course, we examine the ideas, cultural practices, and symbols that shaped the most radical social, cultural, and political transformation in the history of France and the Francophone world. Changing the course of France and its colonies, the French Revolution drew on a powerful new understanding of \"man\" in order to reinvent or throw out entirely age-old notions of sovereignty, the law, God, religion, time, the calendar, the nation, and the family. Crucial to the Revolution's contagious force were the widely consumed texts, images, songs, and spectacles that arguably made it the first mass cultural phenomenon in French history. Beginning with the central philosophical ideas that informed the political challenge to absolute monarchy, we proceed to survey some of the revolution's most significant cultural achievements. These include the emergence of a free press, the birth of human rights, the rise of popular political activism, secularism and the reinvention of religion, the re-constitution of time, the rise of new forms of theatricality and public performance, and a number of lasting symbols such as Marianne, the Bastille, and the Marseillaise. At the same time, we consider the extent to which violence, war, surveillance, terror, colonialism, and aspects of republican ideology itself introduced dangers and threatened the revolution's most cherished gains. We conclude with a consideration of the contemporary antislavery revolution in colonial Haiti, which in many ways exceeded the radicalism of the French Revolution. Throughout the course, we reflect on the legacy of revolutionary changes in our world today. Works by Rousseau, Siey?s, Marat, De Lisle, Robespierre, Maurin De Pompigny, Dessalines, and others.?",

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power, and vulnerability. How have literature, psychoanalysis and philosophy responded to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness? To what extent does seduction affirm an inequitable logic when it comes to age, gender, and race? Does seduction always imply violence? How can we define the notion of consent, and can it offer not only legal redress but ethical care? To what extent can justice regulate sex, fantasies, and desires? To what extent has psychoanalysis problematically altered our notions of guilt and innocence when it comes to seduction? Throughout this seminar, we aim to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction and consent in a broad range of literary, psychoanalytical, legal, and philosophical texts from Europe and the USA. Works covered will include texts by Springora, Kouchner, Nabokov, Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, Srinivasan, Hartman, Butler, Nussbaum, Alcoff, Kukla, and Dougherty.",

They have enriched our understanding and experience of embodiment, while upsetting traditional Western dualisms and partitions, to begin with the nature/culture and the body/mind divides.\n\nFrom the so-called natural body to the trans or cyborgian body, from the speaking body of psychoanalysis to the joyful body of second wave feminism, from biopolitics to body art, from the human organism to the ecology of the living, this course will revisit some chapters in the history of these shifts. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which they have affected gender theory or have been compounded by it, in an attempt to ascertain their stakes for both feminist and postfeminist thought as well as politics.",

In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few healthcare resources. But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities and disparities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce disparities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and climate change. Particular attention is given to the ethics of research during a pandemic and access to vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.",

These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which dimensions ranging from the individual to the geopolitical are considered. \n\nThe third objective is to develop critical thinking and writing abilities to reflect on the multi-dimensional causes and consequences of water insecurity and the appropriateness of potential solutions.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, we will examine the complex relationship between socialist heritage and the influence of neoliberal policies on health care systems in former socialist states, with a special emphasis on the former Yugoslavia. Key course topics include: socialist governance and health care policy; the politics of post-socialist "transition"; the neoliberalization of health care and social protection policies; patients and their rights in the new order; informal economies and clientelism; and challenges in access to healthcare for marginalized social groups. Additionally, we will discuss the complex relationship between socialist legacy and neoliberal transformation regarding the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the former socialist states.

Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students. The classes are the student-centered with an emphasis on collaborative learning.

What do these fascinating figures reveal about the self, which is often perceived through the (mis)recognition of others and an individual's conflictual desires? To what end do we continue to produce expressions of socio-political, psychological and historical ambiguity through representations of life forms perceived to be marvelous or monstrous? Through a selection of narrative fiction, visual representation, films, and critical essays, this seminar examines significant sites of cultural fascination and the anxieties played out in these representations.

Moreover, white Germanophone authors from Franz Kafka to G?nter Grass have celebrated and appropriated elements of Black popular culture in their work. Taking its name from a 2016 novel by the Black American author Darryl Pinckney, this course will largely confine itself to the post-war and post-wall periods (1945 to today) in exploring images of Germany in the works of Black writers, filmmakers, and musicians from Germany and abroad and images of Blackness in the works of white German authors and filmmakers. In doing so, it will treat the contemporary legacies of German colonialism, transformations of discussions about race and racism following World War II and the Holocaust, and conceptions of multiculturalism and Europeanism. East German tributes to Black activists and political leaders like Angela Davis and Nelson Mandela and West German claims of the ?utopic potential' of African American culture will provide material for discussions of internationalist solidarity and cultural appropriation. And students will engage with the works of Black German and Afro-German writers and artists who critique Germany's self-conception as white, as well as texts by thinkers from the African diaspora (e.g., W.E.B. Du Bois and Audre Lorde) for whom Germany served as a source of intellectual and artistic stimulation. \n\nSince the course is taught in English, all readings will be available in English. No knowledge of the German language or prior knowledge of German history is required. For students with reading proficiency in German, texts written in German will be made available in the original language as well.

Considering this, it seems very remarkable that at a closer look, figurations of Jesus abound in Jewish literature. In the seminar we will concentrate on the realm of German language texts from the 18th century to the present dealing with Jesus or related symbols like the cross or scenes of the Passion and Crucifixion. Not surprisingly, in Christian as well as Jewish contexts mixing religious symbolism in literature and art repeatedly provoked scandals. Authors like Carl Einstein were fined for blaspheming Christ, while others like Stefan Zweig, Alfred D?blin or Franz Werfel were accused of having betrayed Judaism. \nOne hypothesis concerning this corpus of texts is that by adopting central narratives and images of the Christian majority society they claim Jewish participation and explore its limits. By focusing on Jesus as a Jew many of these texts rewrite and transform dominant Christian perspectives and expose their inherent violence. If they present the martyred Jesus explicitly as a Jew e.g., connections to persecutions, pogroms and genocide are evoked. At the same time, questions concerning a shared history and modes of respect despite difference are raised. We will discuss how texts problematize assimilation and also try to understand the role of (trans-)figurations of Jesus in 20th Jewish literature about war, the Shoah and the modes of memory.",

We will read histories of this period and memoirs by movement participants, but our focus will be on engaging in collective archival research and, ultimately curating collections of (8-10) documents that aid us in recuperating these instances of successful coalition building across anti-war, women's and gay liberation, and black power/ethnic nationalist movements, as well as the intersectional politics that informed these collaborative projects.

Catastrophic events in the twentieth century (two world wars, the Russian Revolution, world economic depression, the Nazi counter-revolution and Holocaust, and threat of nuclear war) demolished long standing myths that men go forth and fight in order to protect their women and children, who remain passive and secure at home. In the twentieth century, military strategy and technology blurred the boundaries between war zones and home fronts. Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death. At the same time, disillusioned soldiers and veterans saw their war experiences through the threat of gender inversions. During the war, women had been mobilized to do men\'s work. In the 1920s and ?30s, the "new woman" of the century - building on the beginnings of legal equality and the vote - enjoyed greater economic, political, intellectual, and sexual freedoms than their nineteenth century grandmothers and great-grandmothers. If conventional warfare was defined by (and reinforced) traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, did the disruption of those norms mean emancipation for women? Did the war open up utopian hopes for all forms of alternate gender and sexual alignments? Ultimately, was a traditional gendered social order restored after the half century of total war and revolutions? Despite the much touted return to happy domesticity, could the genie of sexual malcontent be ever fully re-contained?',

The past decade has seen an explosion of popular interest in feminism in South Korea. Along with this were competing debates on social and economic inequalities and legislations, as well as debates on gender identity, everyday experiences of discrimination, and overlooked sites of intersectional violence. From the Gangnam station murder to the #Me Too movement, South Korean cultural industry's rise into the global stage through K-Pop has coincided with intense debates at home and abroad about the experience of gendered citizenship and various forms of marginalization. As the scholar Alison Kafer has poignantly shown, thinking through the entanglements of feminist, queer, and disability concerns is important to rethinking exclusionary claims and their attendant problems. Students will look at some of the major points of debate and events that have ignited the increased interest, engaging literary and popular cultural texts, news articles, and scholarship on feminist, queer, and crip theories. At the same time, these recent debates are not necessarily unique or new. To address such, the course will also consider the broader historical context of militarization, colonialism, and the Korean diaspora that have shaped these debates. No prerequisite knowledge of the Korean language or culture is necessary. As a discussion-based seminar with papers, the course encourages students to hone their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",

Although we often think of new media as synonymous with the internet and digital technology, this course will navigate the emergence of various new media from the late 19th century through our current era with an emphasis on gender and race. Working chronologically, this course will highlight key technological innovations including the rise of early cinema, television, and computers. From Black owned ?picture palaces' in the 1910s to Indigenous women creating VR in the 2010s, this course centers an understanding of women, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC as consistent designers and users of emerging technology.\n\nEach week will center around scholarly and primary source materials that illuminate perspectives on how gender and race informed the dynamic relationship between users and technology. This approach will attune students to the lengthy history of new media and technology and the unique and recurrent debates that emerge. It will also offer students the opportunity to study and apply critical gender and racial theory approaches in a media studies context. Class assessment will draw from current approaches in digital humanities. Students will gain practice navigating web based archives for their research and using web based platforms including Slack, Medium, Canva, Soundcloud, and video sharing platforms to present their ideas and research.",

These theoretical texts are placed in dialogue analyzing several contemporary fiction and film. Seminar discussions require synchronous participation. They query how queer theory formulates racial, class and national identities in relation to sexuality, and how it might offer politics beyond those based on identity.

As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective. While they indeed embraced an anti-feminist stance, the Nazis nevertheless sought to incorporate "German" women into the national community and women participated actively in the implementation of Nazi racism.',

Course participants will investigate how a coalitional feminist movement that began in the 1980s is relevant to multiracial feminist analysis, artmaking, and activism today. We will ask how women of color feminists in the 1980s challenged existing concepts of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and identity. We will distinguish women of color feminism from Black feminisms and Latinx feminisms, identifying the key solidarities, intimacies, and alliances that undergird the writings in this field. Course participants will also be asked to challenge their understandings of "theory," examining the rigorous feminist thought at work in contemporary poetry, short stories, film, media, and visual art. \n\nKey texts will likely include This Bridge Called My Back, Dict?e, Sister Outsider, and Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, as well as essays from Barbara Smith, Barbara Christian, E. Patrick Johnson, Hortense Spillers, Grace Kyungwon Hong, and Treva Ellison.

The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of "gender" and "sexuality" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and "religio-racial race making" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people?both within and beyond religious institutions?have resisted and challenged their centrality.',

All scientific data points to the conclusion that decisive and immediate action will be necessary to avoid significant damage to global ecosystems and communities by 2030. This course starts from this sense of urgency and the risk it runs of cuing interventions that, while efficient and effective, entrench existing inequalities. Instead, how can we be mindful of environmental solutions forwarded by marginalized communities? How might changes in global environmental policy also usher in changes in global social justice?\n\nIn this course, we examine these foundational questions of environmental justice (EJ). While our reading list is catered to feminist environmentalist (FE) thought, the activists, artists, writers, and researchers we discuss tackle their work with varied critical identities. Through class discussions and presentations, students will build skills in understanding and evaluating public policy from EJ and FE lenses. Our close analysis of environmental policies and movements is complemented by foundational readings in EJ and FE history. This culminates in a final project of rhetorical analysis on an environmental policy or movement of the student\'s choosing.

The questions we ask in this course include the following: How is the gender binary deeply woven into the policies and practices of social institutions such as education? How does genderism overlap and interact with other forms of oppression such as racism and ableism? For whom does the new visibility of trans identity benefit, and who does it harm? How can we transform educational contexts to be attuned to gender diversity, particularly as it intersects with issues of race/ethnicity, disability, citizenship, and social class?

We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both "top down" and "bottom up" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, and official categorization to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy, classification systems, and citizenship? How have movements and counter-movements around the transformation of gender developed, and how have gendered divides influenced politics of all sorts? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include grassroots democratic activism, the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as examining formal politics and policies. We will read and discuss scholars drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, and we engage with analyses of a variety of contexts across the world (the US, other rich capitalist democracies, postcolonial states and beyond), striving to situate states and political mobilization in global contexts.

We will begin the course and introduce these literary accounts with recordings and written transcripts of selected WPA interviews of former slaves by largely white interlocutors working for the Roosevelt Administration. By exploring the variety of writing, from travel and slave narrative and to fiction, this course will consider the forms and content produced by Black women during the nineteenth century and raise questions concerning at least: shifting political and social identities, authorship, proto-Black feminism, and the possibilities and limitations of the Black woman "archive" versus a "canon."\n\nCourse materials will include Mary Prince, The Slave Narrative of Mary Prince: A West Indian Slave (1831); Hannah Crafts, The Bondswoman\'s Narrative (n.d. 1850s); Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861); Julia Collins, The Curse of Caste; or, The Slave Bride (1865); Elizabeth Keckley, Behind the Scenes; 30 Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House (1868); Alice Dunbar Nelson, Confessions of a Lazy Woman (~1903); Pauline Hopkins, Of One Blood (1902-1903); and Zora Neale Hurston, Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo" (unpub. 1927/2018).  Professors Spigner and Stern will also distribute poems written by Black women across the course of the quarter to supplement our discussion of 19th-century Black women\'s prose works.\n\nEach seminar participant will be required to give a presentation and lead the class for the first hour of the seminar.  Participants will also produce several short, argument-based reflection papers. Final projects will enable students to feature their own research interests in creative installations involving literary texts, historical documents, cinematic or televisual materials and artifacts from the popular culture of the 19th century. Professors Spigner and Stern will consult with all seminar participants on their topics for the final project.',

They continue developing speaking skills and listening comprehension, as well as expanding the Hindi-Urdu grammar and vocabulary. We do so by reading poems, short stories, blogs, watching and discussing movie clips, short films and videos, and making in-class presentations. Some of the topics that we touch upon during the year are short Hindi-Urdu stories, stories from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the tales of Akbar and Birbal, etc. By the end of the three quarter sequence students attain intermediate-mid or higher language proficiency in Hindi-Urdu.\n\nNote: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year.",

These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society. Microhistory is a method of investigation that usually relies on the evidence from judicial trials of otherwise obscure people who found themselves in trouble with the authorities.

Restitution (return of confiscated property), reparations (various forms of material compensation for what cannot be returned physically), and apologies (public recognition of wrongdoing and assuming responsibility for it) are perhaps the most widespread transitional justice methods used to amend the massive breaches of human rights perpetrated by colonial empires, dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, and democracies throughout history. Slowly emerging after World War II, the theory and practice of restitution, reparations, and apologies have developed tremendously especially since the 1990s, even though many governments and citizens are still reluctant to accept them. Which were the most well-known and controversial cases of restitution, reparations, and apologies around the globe during the last 75 years and how were they justified, opposed, and implemented? Is the boom of restitution, reparations, and apologies the sign of a new international morality and democratization spreading worldwide? This course investigates these questions by focusing on theories and cases studies of repairing historical injustices perpetrated by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in Europe (against the victims of the Holocaust and the Gulag), by colonial Empires and settler democracies in the Americas, Australia, and Africa (against Native Americans, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Africans, Australian aboriginals, the Maori of New Zeeland, and Indonesians), by the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II Asia (against the victims of sexual slavery, the so-called "comfort women"), and by the apartheid regime in South Africa (against black Africans).',

Since the birth of the motion picture, films portraying Native Americans (often with non-Native actors in redface) have drawn upon earlier frontier mythology, art, literature, and Wild West performances. These depictions in film have embedded romanticized and stereotyped ideas about American Indians in the imaginations of audiences throughout the United States and around the world. In this course, we will critically examine representations of Native Americans in film, ranging from the origins of the motion picture industry to the works of contemporary Indigenous filmmakers. We will reflect upon revisionist narratives, the use of film as a form of activism, Indigenous aesthetics and storytelling techniques, reflexivity, and parody.

In addition to those formally sentenced by courts, over the past two centuries numerous regimes have ordered the confinement of tens of millions more in enclosed camps of various sorts. Based on the recent past, it might be difficult to imagine a time when mass confinement did not seem an inevitable response of states to peoples considered to be dangerous, but the practice of imprisoning large numbers of people for extended periods of time is, historically speaking, a recent development. A momentously consequential development that, this course hypothesizes, is at once a product of the modern state and a constituent element of the modern era.  \n\nThis course examines the history of two different institutions of confinement - the prison and the camp - that traditionally have been studied separately. With often enormous differences in the degree of regulation and brutality - a critical consideration the course will always keep in mind - those in power have used prisons and camps to control and subdue racial, religious, and other identified groups, and to exploit their labor for public and private use. Cynically or not, authorities have justified confinement as a necessary means to achieve justice, protect society, and rehabilitate the condemned. Irrespective of the great variety of pretexts under which regimes have imprisoned citizens and subjects and the patently immense disparaties in the treatment of those confined, there have been and remain common elements to both the physical structures of incarceration and the lived experiences of prisoners that this course aims to explore and discuss.  The quarter begins with a consideration of alternate forms of punishment common to the premodern era and then follows the development and spread of the modern prison and the proliferation of mass detention camps across the globe over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries until the present day.",

We seek to understand how "MENA" was made as well as how the imaginary of MENA coalesced into a geopolitical entity and conceptual category. Among the topics explored are the history of the idea of MENA and the multiple meanings of "modernity" in that context; the complex relations between MENA and the West, the historical formation of Middle East nation-states, polities, ideologies, identities, and economies; the War on Terror and its impact on the region, and the dynamic struggles unfolding in the region since the 2011 Arab uprisings including mass migration. The course will consider the making of these structures, events, and relationships from a range of perspectives, focusing on historical and cultural production. Primary and secondary course materials will include historical, social science, performance, cinematic, literary, and digital texts.',

Considering both how the state regulated families as well as the many functional families and kinships that existed without state sanction, this course highlights the importance of families in societies and political thought, as well as the lived experience of families in America. As we range over diverse family experiences, we will also follow specific families through time in order to understand how historical changes shaped their family structures.

The course combines a wide range of primary sources as well as cultural products of Jewish and Arabs writers, moviemakers, and artists.

This course takes the approach that the history of modern Israel is a dual narrative of two nations developing side-by-side in the same geographic space of Israel/Palestine, each seeking their own self-determination and social cohesion. Yet, as this course will emphasize, the history and historiography of modern Israel go far beyond the "ripped from the headlines and history books" accounts of decades of clashes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- we will examine the complex internal dynamics of each society-in-progress as well as the external processes that shaped both of their polities and their quest for peace. The syllabus has been organized in 8 week units as departures on the theme of "aliya" (lit. ascendance), a Zionist concept that has attached a positive and religiously-infused valance to Jewish national project and wave of immigrant-absorption prior to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. I have adapted this framework not only to cover both the pre- and post-state period in Israel/Palestine but also to put into focus many groups that were marginalized from this classic history of modern Israel. We will examine both continuity and change since 1948 when it came to the creation of the "new Jew," successive waves of Jewish migration, Zionist settlement, and the "Arab" (or Palestinian) question. The goal of the course is gain a deeper appreciation of not only of the wars on the battlefield and between world leaders over the past century, but the major political, social, cultural, and religious trends that have profoundly shaped two societies in conflict -- and perhaps one day, conciliation. The course will draw not only from scholarly texts but memoir, literature, photography, film, music, and other forms of digital history to gain a multi-faceted view of the modern Israel. Lastly, students will have the opportunity apply their historical knowledge to contemporary debates about the future of the region.',

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level seminar delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two ideas related to "the people." The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.',

In fact, many of the objects that comprise this canon are oftentimes not "objects" at all. Taking a decolonial approach to study the canon of Non-Western art, this course addresses the animacies and ontologies of different categories of "objects" in museum collections, including materially-embodied deities such as Katsina dolls (Hopi) and Orishas (Yoruba diaspora); ancestors that take form as seeds (Pueblo) and ceramics (Mimbres), and materials such as feathers (Aztec, Tupinamba, Hawaiian) and pipestone (Lakota, Dakota and Yankton Sioux) that mediate different realms of existence. The class will also consider the remains of humans, plants, and animals housed in anthropology and natural history museums. The question of objecthood also applies to people conceptualized as property, sold as commodities and displayed within ethnographic and World\'s Fair contexts as well as the land upon which museums are built. We will learn about some of the ways that these "objects" entered into museums as we compare the Western epistemologies by which they are organized there to the indigenous ontologies they occupy within their cultures of origin.',

This class will examine the literary genre that Swift and Peele exploit to devastating critical effect:  satire.  We'll devote special attention to satire's key paradox:  for those who get it (or think they do), satire signifies by not signifying what it literally says.  We will explore high points in the history of satire, beginning with classical authors (Horace, Juvenal) to ponder how satire frames deep ethical concerns about social and political life.  Then we'll read satires from the British eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, grouped into units on sexuality, sex work, marriage, and family; social class and criminality; and empire and race.  The class ends with twentieth- and twenty-first-century film and TV to consider how satire continues to confront crises of our present historical moment.",

          desc: 'Digital Performances in the Era of Virality.\n\nActing as "historians of the present," in this project-based course we will investigate the relationship between performance and digital technology as we track how creators, scholars, and activists have been intervening in contemporary scenes of social unrest. What emerging performance genres?from vaxxies to mental health TikTok videos and from Zoom performances to Instagram livestreams?have taken off during the last two years of social isolation and polarization? What digital aesthetic strategies link personal experience to collective crisis and action? How have artists and activists drawn attention to issues such as anti-Blackness, gender violence, and authoritarianism and their imbrication in the current public health crisis? To address these questions, students will read scholarship on performance and new media, examine digital performances of their choosing, and produce critical essays and/or practice-based research projects that incorporate digital tools. By the end of the course, students will have gained skills to analyze digital performances, to think critically about liveness, embodiment, and mediated performance, and to share their research using a critical digital humanities approach.',

Consequently, there was a thin line between the principles of medicine and pharmacology on the one side and those of cookery on the other: the creation of some dishes - including some classics of Italian cuisine! - can indeed be understood as an attempt to create balanced food that respects the natural complexion of human beings. The course will introduce to the principles of Medieval and Renaissance medicine and how they are reflected in contemporary cookbooks, with examples mainly from Italian texts of the 14th and 15th centuries, that will be examined in their specific language, often influenced by regionalism.',

Just like most courtly poetry of the period, even Shakespeare's sonnets follow several schemes and stereotypes of Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta, the masterpiece by Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374). At the end of the 16th century, with the birth of Italian melodrama pioneered by the likes of Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643), Italian rapidly became a language widely used by European courtiers and aristocrats, and operatic plays - whether of sacred or lay inspiration, Classical or Medieval - were more and more often performed in courtly contexts, especially to mark special occasions (weddings, victories, coronations and so forth). Italian was, more often than not, the language of such belcanto, and it rapidly became customary for high-class people to study it. In 17th-century England, for example, John Florio and Giovanni Torriano wrote dictionaries and grammars that became best sellers. This course will attempt to draw an outline of the early stages of operatic theatre in Europe, in association with the rapid spread of Petrarchism in the language and style of librettos that were set to music.",

We'll read the entire poem and much of its bibliography over the course of the quarter and work in class to develop papers that contribute to our understanding of the poem.

Considered as a cultural text, though, reality television can illuminate some profound truths: about how we decide what is right and wrong, about the tension between written and unwritten rules, and whether anyone can simply be "here to make friends."\n\nIn this course, we ask what reality TV can teach us about the nature of law.  We\'ll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, Scott Shapiro, and others, and then see how their ideas stand up to the test of shows like Survivor, The Bachelor, FBoy Island, Ink Master, and Bachelor in Paradise.

In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning.

In particular we will be touching on some of the aspects of the theory of mixed Hodge modules and the relationship between all of the above and notions in birational geometry (singularities of pairs, multiplier ideals, vanishing theorems), and some of the recent theory of Hodge ideals.\n\nIn terms of background, the course will gradually require more and more knowledge (again, over at least two quarters): first all sorts of algebra and a bit of manifolds, then a decent grasp of algebraic geometry, then basic Hodge theory, and finally a little birational geometry. There will be a webpage containing references, and eventually some notes.",

We will study neural circuits and behavior using mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, and circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques through assigned projects. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week.\n NOTE 1: <strong> This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems. If any of these might pose extraordinary challenges for you, please talk to the instructor before registering.</strong>    \n NOTE 2: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning (before 9:15 am) and the end of the day and it is an ongoing task. Later in the course you likely also will need to come to finish experiments. Time outside regularly scheduled class is typically 2 or more hours per week, scheduled to our mutual convenience, and motivated students often elect to spend more time.

We will discuss how "nature" (the genetic makeup) and "nurture" contribute to shape individual behavior and explore the implications of this interaction at the level of society, from philosophical and ethical aspects to medical and legal considerations. We will often follow a historical perspective to understand how our thinking on this subject has changed with the advancement of scientific knowledge and with the evolution of what we think is acceptable in society.\n\nThe class content will be strongly anchored in basic science: we will first learn concepts of both classical and modern genetics and neurogenetics (with emphasis on human genetics). We will then talk about how genes can determine or influence behavior: we will discuss how genes build neural circuits and how brain circuits in turn produce behavior (often using animal models as examples). Starting from primary research and reviews, students will be asked to discuss relevant topics in this area including the genetics of aggression, parental behavior, social behavior, predisposition to mental illness or disease etc.\n\nAssessment will be based on a combination of quizzes, in class presentations and a final essay based on original literature research.

We will critically compare and appraise the different  methodologies, aims, concepts of power, and interpretive politics within these analyses of sexuality and/or the family  as contingent formations. We will  give attention to several recent publications  by the philosophers under consideration that  have  prompted contemporary revision of established interpretations of these bodies of work. And we will ask how the work of Beauvoir, Fanon, Foucault and Castro-G?mez continues to be resituated today within  a number of fields including  contemporary critical theory, decolonial theory, critical race studies,  and gender and sexualities studies. We will ask: what new concepts have now emerged from these transits and translations of mid twentieth-century theory?",

The U.S. government has also built up an impressively large debt load over the past sixty years (over $13 trillion before the March 2020 eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic). But while debt touches most people's lives in some fashion, the complex history and politics of modern debtor-lender relations remains, for most, essentially unknown territory. The central purpose of this course, then, is to deepen our understanding of how we got to this point. How did debt - both private and public - swell to current levels? How were markets for debt built? What were the politics of some key turning points in the history of debt? How did differences in the terms of access to credit produce and reinforce social inequalities? When do debt markets break down and how do societies recover from debt crises? Under what conditions are debts honored and when can (and should) debt contracts be repudiated?",

On the heels of the conservative legal movement, the Court has reshaped important policy domains including voting rights, campaign finance regulation, and gun control. In response, liberal backlash has emerged with influential policymakers calling for reform?ranging from term limits to adding additional seats to the Court to dilute conservative influence. All the while, the nomination and confirmation process has become extremely contentious: Senate Republicans refused to consider President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 and Senate Democrats invoked the filibuster in a failed attempt to block President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch a year later. In this course, students will examine the politics of the modern U.S. Supreme Court. Using a combination of academic scholarship, journalism, and legal documents, students will consider important questions of what influences judicial decisionmaking, how the Court became dominated by conservative jurists, whether the Court's jurisprudence really \"matters\", and if the Court advances or hinder American democracy. Although we will read a handful of legal documents, this course will not be a constitutional law class per se. Rather than focusing on the legal reasoning of the justices (as you would in constitutional law) we will examine the Court within the broader political system. Students will also sharpen their ability to think critically, collect evidence, present an argument, and join others in a collective inquiry. Most importantly, perhaps, students will be expected to engage constructively with one another throughout the course as we work together to improve our understanding of the Supreme Court and American government writ large.",

As we chart Blacks' political gains and setbacks, we will focus on class, gender, and other cleavages in the population to see how different groups have fared. We also will examine Blacks' fraught relations with whites, their engagement with mainstream political institutions, and their efforts to secure their rights and advance their interests from within and outside these institutions at the national and local level. The course materials cover a mix of topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the Civil Rights Movement. These include: ongoing intergroup conflict and prejudice; segregation; social provision and criminal justice policies; systemic anti-Black racism in law enforcement; racial dynamics in voting and access to the ballot; partisan politics; and Blacks' electoral fortunes, including the election of the country's first Black president and the ensuing political developments.

The global distribution of economic and political power is shifting. Policymakers in the United States and elsewhere have grown increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and fairness of the international organizations charged with governing globalized markets. A nationalist-populist tide swept into the political scene in many countries in recent years. And, of course, the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global diffusion of lockdowns to control the spread of the virus, and the attendant severe, synchronized economic downturns provoked many prominent observers, including the newly-appointed Chief Economist of the World Bank, Carmen Reinhart, to wonder if the pandemic is the "last nail in the coffin of globalization." This course is intended to take stock of market globalization in light of these integrating and fragmenting forces. What is market globalization? Are its effects on the economic fortunes of individuals and groups in historically rich countries different than the effects in developing countries? Has market globalization gone too far - or has it not gone far enough? These are the kinds of questions that will be discussed in the course. The course is organized around five main topics: (1) conceptualizing market globalization; (2) describing transformations in the constituent parts of market globalization (international trade, globalized production, finance, and labor migration); (3) exploring how different national styles of capitalism in the historically rich Northern countries have adjusted to pressures generated by "deeper" forms of market globalization; (4) the relationship between market globalization, economic development, and global inequality; (5) exploring the challenges to globalization posed by the recent rise of nationalist-populist ideologies in many countries and the fragmenting effects of the COVID-19 public health crisis and global economic downturn.',

Authoritarianism has proven a resilient force, and regressions from democracy back to authoritarianism, often with mass political support, seem to be the new trend. The focus of this course is on problems of democratic regimes. We will examine debates about the meaning of democracy, how authoritarian regimes are transformed into democratic regimes, and how these survive, fall, or decay. We will also question the dichotomy between "democracy" and "authoritarianism" as we examine how they often coexist in stable ways and authoritarianism is exercised through democratic institutions.',

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to "the people." The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy.',

This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the "YouTube" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense "ground game" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages, and finding a willing press that was, at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.',

For example, the ends justify the means. So what? Which ends? What means? And, do they really, all ends and all means? Certainly not, though his chosen protagonists will leave you wondering. Famously, one of his major works is in defense of republics, another is an equally forceful support of principalities. Contradictory? Are there any threads that run through all of his works? What motivated Machiavelli? I will take a position (and in fact, having set up this class the way I did, I already have) and so will you. We are going to read works by Machiavelli rather than about Machiavelli: a variety of different genres, diplomatic briefs, his most famous treatises, a comedic play, and some memoranda. In all of these pieces of writing there is more than meets the eye so in no way should you think of these primary-source documents as mere "information." That we find Machiavelli clear and forthright has more to do with his nearly single-handed revolution in political philosophy than any simplicity in his works. In short, after Machiavelli, we all look at the world in the terms that he laid down. The text, the subtext, the context, and everything in between those lines is important to understand Machiavelli. In many ways Machiavelli is a vehicle for what I hope we can accomplish this term, namely, to introduce you to a scholarly community. I hope to introduce you to how scholars read, how scholars think, the ambiguities that cause us confusion, the questions that pique our curiosity, to give you a rich experience with how scholars write, and finally, how to ask and try to answer scholarly questions. Along the way we will sample some of Machiavelli\'s insights, analytical leaps, and carnivalesque humor to appraise the founder of Political Science as we know it, the figure who many see as the founder of modernity itself.',

In approaching Arendt\'s writings in terms that she uniquely designated as "political theory," this seminar\'s theoretical orientation begins from a perspective that places her influential understanding of "politics" first, exploring a complex of perplexities in late modernity central to her warning to "think what we are doing." The seminar\'s textual and interpretive orientation is comprehensive, covering a wide range of Arendt\'s essays and articles on freedom, authority, the concept of history, tradition and modernity in western political thought, refugees, statelessness, violence, civil disobedience, moral responsibility, political judgment, and truth and lying in politics, while structured around three influential books still pertinent to what she called "the burden of our time": The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951); The Human Condition (1958); and On Revolution (1963), as well as her incendiary exploration of the "banality of evil" in the controversial Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963). Although we will be mainly concerned with primary texts, establishing fluency and understanding of a range of Arendt\'s works, secondary sources in Arendt studies will also be integral to the syllabus and seminar discussion and allowed for inclusion in the final paper. The seminar should give you graduate-level expertise in Arendt\'s political theory and enable you to bring her writings to bear upon a wide range of historical and contemporary, global and national, problems of politics in late modernity.',

What is "modern" about Islamic revivalism and how does it shape Islamic activism? How did Islamic political thought evolve and adapt to changing political circumstances within Muslim societies in an increasingly globalized world? We draw from intellectual history, comparative politics and political theory to examine some of the major ideological currents, political movements and intellectual figures who sought, since the end of the late 19th century, to reconstruct the political and social dimensions of Muslim societies and countries along Islamic lines. The course focuses on the intellectual origins of the resurgence and spread of "political Islam". Our readings include primary sources in translation as well as secondary sources from history, Islamic studies, political science, and anthropology. Topics include: decline and revival, Islamic reform, Islam and modernity, rationality, ijtihad (Islamic legal independent reasoning), Shura (deliberative decision- making), Muslim unity, pan-Islamism, Secularism, Sharia, Caliphate, Fundamentalism, Islamic state, Democracy, Islam and the West, Gender (in) equality, Liberal Islam, Human rights, Violence, Jihad.',

We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both "top down" and "bottom up" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, and official categorization to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy, classification systems, and citizenship? How have movements and counter-movements around the transformation of gender developed, and how have gendered divides influenced politics of all sorts? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include grassroots democratic activism, the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as examining formal politics and policies. We will read and discuss scholars drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, and we engage with analyses of a variety of contexts across the world (the US, other rich capitalist democracies, postcolonial states and beyond), striving to situate states and political mobilization in global contexts. The course draws on gender and sexuality studies, political science, sociology, history, and anthropology to understand gender, power and politics.',

We will be particularly interested in discussing how in the last two decades a number of Brazilian films have blurred the boundaries between fiction and documentary, with an increasing emphasis on social and historical issues.  In order to do so, we will first study the development of realism in literature throughout the 20th century. Although we will pay some attention to film techniques, our major concern will be with narrative strategies, ideological content and the ethics of representation.  Although there will inevitably be days in which I will lecture, we will rely heavily on class discussion in a seminar format.  Students will have the opportunity to do their readings and write their papers in English or Portuguese.",

We will look at "weird" beliefs within our culture and maybe some cross-cultural examples to understand what leads to development and maintenance of beliefs. We\'ll also consider how to evaluate rationality of beliefs. Among the specific topics we may cover are: science denial, superstition, parapsychology, conspiracy theories, ghosts, near-death and out-of-body experiences, witchcraft, alien abduction, repressed memories of abuse, and creationism/intelligent design. Students will use a wide variety of academic and popular media resources (including empirical research articles, ethnographic descriptions, philosophical arguments, popular press books, and documentary films) to explore the bases for these beliefs and practices.',

The topics we will cover include research methods, the biology of behavior and emotion, perception, memory, thinking and problem solving, emotion, social influences on behavior, personality, and psychological disorders. A combination of class lectures, readings, and (online) laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of an online laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first?hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit.",

We will look at the basic building blocks of temperament and how they these fundamental characteristics of children develop into the major personality characteristics of adults. We will seek to answer questions about what motivates us, how we manage our emotions internally and in social settings, and how we interact as social beings. We will also look at ways in which personality traits may be stable over time or may be susceptible to change. Finally, we will examine the relation between personality and mental health. In what ways do different personality characteristics predispose us to or protect us from the development of psychopathology? What does it mean to have a disordered personality?\n\nIn this course, we will use both a book that will serve as our primary text and additional required articles that will include research and theoretical articles. Both sources of reading will be critical for understanding this course and (especially information from the book) will not be fully covered in lectures. The research articles may be challenging if you have never read a psychology article before, and I will go over what you need to know and allow time for questions about these articles in class. Class will also cover material that is not explicitly in the readings and will include examples and discussions that will be instrumental to your ability to master the material. If you do not attend class regularly, you should expect that the exams will probably be very challenging for you.",

In other words, we will examine the phenomena and processes associated with one's beliefs about members of social groups (stereotypes), attitudes and evaluative responses toward group members (prejudice), and behaviors toward members of a social group based on their group membership (discrimination).  Also, we will study how these issues shape the experiences of social group members, especially when they are members of low-status and/or minority groups.  In order to explore these topics, we will primarily focus on large societal groups that differ on dimensions of identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.  Rather than relying on anecdotal evidence, cultural truisms, or philosophical orientations to address these issues, we will approach these issues wearing the hat of an experimental social psychologist.  That is, we will examine traditional and contemporary theories of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, punctuated by empirical findings.  Finally, we will apply the theoretical and empirical work to current events and issues.",

Students will develop an in-depth and integrative understanding of how approaching the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination from a social psychological perspective improves our understanding of intergroup relations and human behavior more generally.\n\n2. The course will highlight the value of thinking about politically sensitive issues from a scientific perspective.  The purpose of this class is to engage thinking about stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, not to proselytize others to a particular worldview or to be a vehicle through which to further anyone\'s political or personal agendas.\n\n3. This course will help students identify and understand how psychological processes affect human behavior between members of different groups in the real world.  In other words, the application of findings and theories should help students "make sense" of why people do the things they do.  These insights should help students better understand the events they see in the news, with their friends, in their families, and within their communities.',

Students will consider a variety of viewpoints on the promises and pitfalls of happiness through reading an array of leading thinkers including The Dalai Lama, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Sarah Ahmed, Matthieu Ricard, and many others, with an eye toward encouraging students to find their own way in this rich conversation about what makes a good life.',

What are the earliest pieces of evidence for the New Testament? How does the New Testament fit with what we know about books and readers in the ancient world?

We open by considering themes of dying and the afterlife, food and drink, health and medicine, gender and family. We then turn to Daoist traditions of visual culture that envision the human body as intimately connected with the cosmos and picture the body's interior as a miniature landscape populated by a pantheon of gods. We read ghost stories and analyze the complex history of footbinding. Finally, we conclude with two case studies of religion and the body in contemporary China, one situated on the southwestern periphery, the other in the capital city of Beijing. Throughout the quarter, we investigate how the body has mediated relationships between Buddhist, Daoist, and popular religious traditions. By the course's end, students will gain key resources for understanding historical and contemporary Chinese culture, and new perspectives on what it means to be religious and embodied.",

Throughout, we will be reading a variety of genres - a play, short stories, works of philosophy, political documents, and works of theology.  We open with a reading of The Merchant of Venice to examine the economic role of Jews in medieval and post-Renaissance Europe, Christian understandings of Judaism, the expulsion of the Jews from England and other countries in Europe, the creation of Jewish ghettos, Jewish cultural and religious responses to ghettoization, Jewish conversions to Christianity and Islam, the rise of the Marranos and D?nmeh and their migrations, and the perceptions of Jews spawned as a consequence, as well as Jewish self-perceptions. \n\nWe begin by investigating various aspects of what constitutes varieties of the "modern" in Jewish experiences in different parts of the world, including Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the United States, and we will also examine a variety of historiographical debates on the topic, ranging in their interpretations from the impact of 1492 to the Marrano experience of hiding one\'s Jewish identity to the Frankist and Sabbatian challenges to Jewish rabbinic authority as well as conversion to Islam and to Christianity. The course will look at the transformation of the economic and political roles played by Jews in modern times and their impact on Jewish religious practices and beliefs, the struggle for emancipation, the rise of antisemitism, and debates among Jews over assimilation versus Zionism. Constructions of "modern" Jewish identity and religious expressions will be studied in relation to the emergence of both Reform Judaism and Hasidism, and by examining differences between the Judaism constructed in Christian Europe and the Judaism constructed in Islamic regions. \n\nThe course will also examine the crucial developments of the twentieth century, including mass migration to the United States, the Zionist movement, the Russian revolution, the Holocaust, post-WWII recovery and the establishment of the State of Israel. The differing impact of these movements on men and women will be examined.',

The historical record shows that individuals born cisgender male and socialized as men, namely white heterosexual men, have historically and contemporaneously dominated and controlled the North Americas and the globe. They have upheld their hegemonic and institutional power by wielding the social constructions of "gender" and "sexuality" to their benefit, often using religion, and specifically white Christianities, biblical fundamentalism, and "religio-racial race making" to regulate sexual bodies gendered and understood as non-white and non-man. This course examines the interconnected histories of race, sexuality and religion in the Americas through the vantage point of African American Studies, and specifically Black Queer Studies, and charts the construction of these categories and how racialized people?both within and beyond religious institutions?have resisted and challenged their centrality.',

The rest of the class works through these materials to prepare for a discussion that is then led by the student who works on this topic.

Although the topics of this so-called Golden Age of Russian literature were many, particular emphasis was on the genre of elegy. The Russian elegy is a kind of "the glass bead game," if we use this title of Hesse\'s novel, that each of the Russian poets tried to add with his own brilliance, not with just sorrow and tears. To find out how brilliance and approach were different in each particular case, is one of the intellectual adventures that this course offers.',

It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges. \n\nThe disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges.   In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. \n\nThe collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has rejected Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.",

Utopias were often defined as counter critiques of existing social arrangements and at times people actually attempted to create and live in "intentional communities" based on their ideals. In this seminar we will explore fictional and real utopian communities in different historical periods? such as preindustrial agricultural religious settlements (for example the Amish or Oneida), planned industrial communities (the factory town of Pullman in Chicago) and anti-and post-industrial communities (the Walden II "hippy" commune Twin Oaks emerging out of the 60s). We will use these and other cases as critical analyses of existing societies highlighting the social problems of their day?issues such as inequalities of wealth and power, individual versus collective priorities, changing family structure, sexual relations and gender roles, defining and dealing with deviants, and institutions like governance, education, work and leisure. We will explore in detail the founding, the dynamics, and the fates of attempts to live in real utopian communities. We will conclude with a consideration of the role of utopian thought in contemporary society for example the role of digital technology and smart cities in addressing climate change. We will also make use of Chicagoland as a setting to explore utopian thought and communities from the Burnham Master Plan for the City of Chicago itself to Olmsted\'s planned suburb of Riverdale to the religious community of Zion.',

Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers?\n\nSociology is a huge field of study, and includes and enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them.

Next, we explore the causes and consequences of gender inequalities in important social institutions such as the family, the education system, and the labor market. We conclude by considering gender inequality in an international comparative context to understand crosscutting similarities and differences between the US and both high- and low-income contexts.

Racism, ethnocentrism, and nationalism are related in ideas of ancestry and difference, and we will explore together theoretical approaches to understanding the social, cultural, political and economic aspects of difference. The course centers on racialization (how individuals/groups are sorted into races), global and local racial paradigms (the rules of race-making and racial assignment), and why these denigrating mechanisms are so difficult to eradicate. We also examine what antiracism looks like and how it might be achieved. Despite the challenging course content, this class is a blast!',

This course covers central tenets in the sociology of technology by pairing an empirical focus on a different technology each week with a theoretical paradigm. A total of eight technologies will serve as the exemplars through which the question(s) concerning technology will be explored: bicycles, cars, computers, facial recognition, genetic sequencing, soap, shipping containers and virtual reality. Each of these technologies is approached as a window into the social, political, racial, and economic determinants of technological innovation. The central goal of the course is to equip students with the tools for unpacking the technologies societies take for granted and critically engaging with new technologies that may reproduce social inequities. While much of the scholarship we will consider is broadly sociological, some of it is drawn from other fields, and part of the goal of the course is to show what is gained when we think about technology from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Whether or not you get a job, who will date or marry, whether or not you\'ll catch a contagious disease are all affected by the social networks in which you live. This class explores the ways our social networks shape society, and how society shapes our social networks. \n\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques.  As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among social actors.  This approach views the social world as patterns or regularities in relationships among interacting units and focuses on how such patterns affect the behavior of network units or actors.  A "structure" emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision making, social revolutions, organizational merges, global finance and trade markets, delinquent youth behaviors, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on.  As a methodological approach, SNA refers to a catalog of techniques steeped in mathematical graph theory and now extending to statistical simulation, and algebraic models.  This course surveys the growing field of SNA, emphasizing the merger of theory and method, while gaining hands on experience with network data and software. As such, the course is designed to be (roughly) equal parts theory and methods. Students will leave the course with the ability to understand and apply SNA in a variety of contexts.',

One such problem may inquire, "what if industry x continues to grow at the same rate?" Another may ask, "what if blacks and whites had the same educational distributions?" And a third perhaps wonders, "what if you found yourself in an iterated prisoner\'s dilemma fighting for your life?" Social simulations are super fancy what if problems that use a mix of math and computational code to answer a complex of important questions. This course is an introduction to a variety of what if problems and the flexible set of methods that can be used to answer the related questions. \n\nThe course begins by exploring simulations of populations and their dynamics?collectively called demographic methods. Using a simple set of empirical parameters, students will learn to simulate changes in population size and composition, as well as the formal demographic processes of fertility, mortality and migration. In this section, the what if problems center on the role of population parameters in producing both aggregate outcomes and individualized measures such as life expectancy and total fertility rate. After covering the demographic simulations, the focus turns to agentic simulations (i.e., agent-based models), where, in addition to encountering fixed population parameters, the artificially simulated and independent agents employ specific strategies. The what if questions for this part of the course center on the role of individual strategies in shaping population outcomes. During this portion, students will learn to create and analyze basic agentic simulations of large, complex social behaviors such as segregation and cooperation.\n\nAt the heart of all the methods covered in the course is a particular way of looking at the world, simultaneously from the top down and the bottom up. The course aim is to introduce students to the mix of methodological tools for social simulation and the nuanced theoretical perspective that their use entails. Students will learn and apply these techniques through a series of weekly problems sets performed in either Excel or NetLogo.',

          desc: '"Indigeneity and Settler Colonialism"\n\nIn this seminar, we examine settler colonialism as a political, social, cultural and economic formation, and Indigenous resistance, resilience and resurgence, focusing on the US in historical, comparative and global perspective. Settler colonialism is a distinctive form of social organization, which emerges within a global context of empires and colonial domination of peoples of the Americas, Africa, Oceania and Asia by Europeans and their descendants, in which settlers "come to stay" (Veracini 2010) and seek replacement of indigenous peoples, rather than the extraction and transfer of wealth to the "home" country (Bacon and Norton 2019). It is a constituent part of modernity. As Glenn (2015) has argued: "The settler goal of seizing and establishing property rights over land and resources required the removal of indigenes, which was accomplished by various forms of direct and indirect violence, including militarized genocide. Settlers sought to control space, resources, and people not only by occupying land but also by establishing an exclusionary private property regime and coercive labor systems." We need increased recognition of Indigenous values, worldviews, and lifeways, as much sociological work omits the Indigenous perspective, and consequently sociological explanations are often ill-fitting or insufficient in understanding the "fourth world" of Native nations and their relations with settler societies. Notably, we seek to engage with analyses of inequality, power and difference that reflect the distinctive Indigenous experience within US settler colonialism: "Native peoples were colonized and deposed of their territories as distinct peoples - hundreds of nations - not as a racial or ethnic group?"  (Dunbar-Ortiz 2014, p.xiii). The readings are multidisciplinary - covering sociology, Native studies, other social sciences and history, and we incorporate the works of diverse Indigenous scholars, philosophers and thought leaders. Topics covered include: indigenous perspectives on time, power and knowledge; key concepts for studying groups; overviews of the literatures on empire and colonialism and the entanglements of social science with settler colonialism; the emergence and co-constitution of modernity, empire, settler colonialism, states and indigeneity; property, dispossession and capitalism; biopolitics, reproduction, sexuality, gender; the US as a settler colonial formation; political contestation over settler colonialism and indigenous rights; native sovereignty, representation, decolonization and Indigenous justice.',

While introducing students to the social and historical context in which the works were written, the course will focus on the following issues: the cultural and political dimensions of literature; the representation of class, gender, and race; literary enactments of modernity through the literary form and avant-garde aesthetics; the tensions between nationalism and cosmopolitism; and the positionality of Latin American literatures during and after the Cold War.",

(3) What are the similarities and differences between the "Jewish Question" and the "Muslim Problem"?

At a time when racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and right-wing populist movements are ascendant in Spain and across Europe, we will work collaboratively to not only answer these questions, but to formulate new ones. To do so, we will consult scholarship in anthropology, history, cultural theory, and philosophy as well as on fiction, film, and journalism as resources. Throughout the term, we will be especially attuned to the forms of inclusion and exclusion that have affected Jews and Muslims in Spain, always with an eye toward how such abstractions come to matter in everyday life.',

In addition to classical parametric statistics (e.g., two-sample t-test), we will also cover nonparametric approaches (e.g., rank-based test) and resampling based approaches (e.g., permutation test) when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By the end of the quarter, students should be able to (1) formulate statistical questions for a life science question; (2) use visualization techniques to explore the data; (3) choose the appropriate statistical methods and justify the choice; (4) perform data analysis using R programming; (5) describe and present the data analysis results.",
