And the consent of the governed regarding public policy and policymakers is informed by a free and responsible press. But what happens when this process is distorted by a disinformation campaign set in motion by government elites who attempt to engineer public consent? What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making?  How might the conventions of journalism?the traditional rules and practices that guide our work?be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized?pitting identifiable groups against each other?in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term \"fake news\" has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe.  Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging \"fake news\" are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process.  How have we been complicit?  What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference? What is the public responsibility in achieving a degree of literacy, particularly with increasing reliance on social media?

The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter. \n\nOur work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new? \n\nThis is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism. \n\nThe course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway. \n\nEach week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet.

This process may become more difficult to engage with after you leave the supportive environment of this institution. Therefore our time here is also pressing.\n\nIn this course we will explore printmaking through the notion of \"press time,\" \"pressing times,\" and \"precious time.\" We will think about the temporal nature of printmaking and engage with how print's many processes require a commitment in time to produce results (impressions) that appear on the page as instantaneous. We will also consider how the time we have in the studio functions in relation to the time we experience in the outside world and in contemporary media. Being at a socially and politically challenging moment in history, we will consider the feeling of being \"out of time\" and how an art practice?and particularly a printmaking practice?can engage with, slowdown or accelerate this contemporary feeling. Last, we will discuss the history of print as a technique which greatly reduces the time needed to reproduce texts and images. We will discuss this acceleration and how contemporary practices in print might engage with these histories."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Course cost is approximately

Indeed, this aspiration for reunion expresses a vigorous and deep historical belief in the shared ethnic and cultural heritage of the entire peninsula that imagines North and South Korea as tragically and temporarily separated entities bound to be reunited. At the same time, the contemporary everyday meaning of the word \"Korea\" (hankuk) is often limited to only their nation for many young South Koreans. How do we understand this seeming contradiction? With this question in mind, this course provides students with a set of critical frames for exploring Korean history and culture while simultaneously questioning presumptions of a nation or civilization with an unchanging or seemingly \"natural\" essence. This course focuses on the modern cultural history of the Korean peninsula by investigating the discursive constructions of national subjectivity carried out by disparate groups and social institutions since the Choso?n Dynasty's inclusion in the modern nation-state world system and the political realities resulting from those discursive constructions. The term culture in the course title is defined in a broad sense as it encompasses not only works of art but also systems of thought and social practices developed throughout the history of modern Korea."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"TBA"}]}],"023538":[{"unique_id":"17323","instructors":["David Sol Boyk"],"mode":null,"title":"Introductory Topics in South Asian Literature and Culture","subject":"ASIAN_LC","number":"260-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"12:20","room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"018603":[{"unique_id":"18611","instructors":["Antonio   Terrone"],"mode":null,"title":"Introductory Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures","subject":"ASIAN_LC","number":"290-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"15:20","room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"023536":[{"unique_id":"18615","instructors":["Stefan   Henning"],"mode":null,"title":"Advanced Topics in Chinese Literature and Culture","subject":"ASIAN_LC","number":"300-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"AY 21-22\n\"How have urban Chinese challenged the authoritarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party in the twenty-first century?  What are the activist causes around which urban Chinese have rallied despite the risk of state repression?  Given that activists risk persecution, prison, and torture, who would do this?  How do activists maintain the emotional resilience to stand up to authoritarian rule?  What are activists' tactics and strategies?  To answer these questions, we will study reporters, labor organizers, environmental activists, religious activists, lawyers, and feminist activists.\n\tMany activists oppose the authoritarian state in the name of freedom.  I have found that many urban Chinese are happy, or at least content, in their lives today.  The insight that hundreds of millions of people can be happy or content even though they are lacking freedom is so astonishing to me, I have begun to question my own understanding of freedom.  Is freedom a specifically Western concept?  Should the notion of freedom have universal relevance?  Should we demand of the Chinese people that they democratize?  Or is this demand Orientalist?  Or racist?  Is the demand that Chinese democratize another way of saying, \"They must become like us\"?  The Chinese Communist Party is a threat to United States democracy.  Thinking about China and acting toward China, how are we to combine the defense of our democracy and the injunction to stay clear of Orientalism?  Who is a greater threat to our democracy, the Chinese Communist Party or the Republican Party?  It turns out that we, unfortunately, cannot study Chinese activists without finding a framework to evaluate Chinese authoritarian rule in political and ethical terms.\n\tEvaluating Chinese authoritarian rule involves thinking about ourselves.  Are some Americans benefitting from authoritarian rule in China?  Is the Chinese Communist Party profitable for some Americans?  Would the United States economy collapse without Chinese poverty?  Who are we in moral, political, and ethical terms to claim the high ground and criticize the Chinese Communist Party?  It is possible to argue that Western modernity is flawed beyond rescue.  From this perspective, are we in a desperate search for an alternative modernity?  Can China be our inspiration for an alternative modernity?  Or, would you agree with those Hong Kong activists who have coined the term Chinazi to indicate that, in their view, China increasingly resembles Hitler's Germany?\""},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"No prerequisites.

But like all human activities, it does not exist in objective isolation, but rather within a societal context. And biological phenomena, such as infection and disease, interact with non-biological elements of human society. This course aims to contextualize the study of biology towards a better understanding of how social and cultural histories and dynamics have had a profound effect on both biological research as well as biological phenomena, and how social, political and economic parameters influence the impact of scientific breakthroughs and the outcomes of biological events such as epidemics. The topics we will cover, among others: the cultural, political and societal barriers to reaping the benefits of biological research; the damaging legacies of racism, sexism and colonialism on the biological research enterprise; the role of communications in the field of biology; and select biological topics in evolution, genetics and disease.

Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity.

In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety.

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year.

That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion.  This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.  For example:\n\n- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure.  Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.\n\n- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.\n\nIn these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis.  You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.  \n\nChemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

Beginning with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century debates about historical materialism and the uses of history and literary history as disciplines, we will survey the development and invocations of historicism as an approach to literary study across colonial, imperial, modernist, postcolonial, and environmental episodes in literary history. How does historicism fare in addressing diverse periods? For example, while British Victorian studies recently faced critiques of dominant tendencies toward \"positivist historicism,\" some of the most energizing work in postcolonial literary studies has been deeply historicist in inclination. How has climate change provoked new visions of historical time crossing the traditional periods? Must we continue to follow Jameson's famous injunction to \"always historicize!\" or do we rather find ourselves in a \"weak\" theoretical state of affairs by which \"we cannot not historicize?\" How do we understand Roland Barthes's claim that \"a little formalism turns one away from History, but ? a lot brings one back to it?\" What is historicism good for?

What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance. Typically, this will involve reading the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of the papers to get a general overview of the contribution, research question and methodological approach.  We will analyze data using Stata or R and may also use ArcGIS, a digital mapping program."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"ECON 281, ECON 310-1, ECON 310-2.

My hope is that the topics covered in this course will stimulate your interests to further explore and develop research ideas of your own, either for a senior thesis (ECON 398 - Senior Seminar), independent study (ECON 399) or in graduate school."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Two 80-minute lectures per week, plus a weekly TA discussion session."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"The overall grade in this course will be based on: one midterm (15%), one final exam (25%), a class presentation (10%), four problem sets (40%) and one \"Essay\" (10%). The class presentation will depend on the class size. Students will be asked to present (in the style of a referee report- more on this will be explained in class) and lead the class discussion of one article. The \"Essay\" is really an abbreviated research proposal. The goal is to stimulate your curiosity to develop a potential empirical project that you would like to explore in the near future. It will be at most three pages, should include a main hypothesis/research question(s), brief overview of the relevant literature, description of potential data to be used, and empirical strategy that would best answer your hypothesis. More guidelines will be provided later. At least one of the four problem sets will involve the use of Stata. Also, at the end of every problem set I will ask you a couple questions that will help you think about a potential research idea based on the concepts covered in the problem set. I will give you feedback on your responses that will hopefully make it easier for you to write your \"essay\" towards the end of the quarter.  This is completely optional (i.e. your responses will  not be graded)."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"The main text for this course is:\nUrban Economics by Arthur O'Sullivan, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill 2019.

In this course, we will focus on works of fiction and autobiography that pay special attention to the role that college plays in that journey. These works portray the formative childhood influences and conflicts that shape the protagonists. In the chapters on college, they dramatize the different ways that higher education helps the characters navigate the difficult and confusing task of taking control of their lives and coming to a deeper understanding of who they are and what they want from life. In each work, we also get to see the impact of their college experiences after the characters have graduated and entered the so-called \"real world.\" The works explore such questions as: Does college change who you are or, rather, help you to understand who you are? How does it impact your relationships with your family? What factors contribute to success in college and beyond, and what is even meant by \"success\"? Through reflection on and discussion, you'll begin to answer those and other questions for yourself too.

In each work, college is a turning point for the main character, helping them to mature and move forward in their lives with clearer self-understanding and sense of purpose.

Thus, sociolinguistic diversity?differences across and within languages and dialects?is inevitable. This seminar will explore how language difference is situated in current US and global discourses, considering language in written, spoken, and signed forms. We will disrupt monolingual ideologies that infiltrate those discourses, focusing on language diversity as an asset to individuals, cultures, and institutions. The course will consider college as one of those institutions and will explore language diversity and linguistic social justice as part of your first-year experience at Northwestern. Using scholarly readings from sociolinguistics and writing pedagogy along with popular non-fiction, the course will consider how we can sustain sociolinguistic diversity, how we can foster equity, access, and inclusion around language difference, and how our sociolinguistic diversity sustains us. You will formulate and explore your own questions about language diversity and linguistic justice in papers, presentations, and class discussions. \n\nOur seminar will operate as a community that celebrates our diverse language use and as a system of academic, practical, and emotional support as you begin your college experience.

In other words, the seminar is designed to help you make the transition to a college mindset. We will begin the seminar by quickly exploring a few controversial topics, evaluating how well writers in both the scholarly and the popular press support their opinions and persuade audiences. In the process, you will learn how to evaluate sources, read critically, listen and consider opposing points of view, and develop a powerful response. Then you will have the opportunity to select a controversial topic of your choice and research it in depth, using library resources, the Internet, interviews, and surveys. In addition to learning research techniques, you will also learn techniques for presenting your ideas persuasively, both orally and in writing. By the end of the course, you will be in position to discuss your ideas in a thoughtful, authoritative way, becoming a more effective contributor in college classes as well as in conversations with family and friends.

For instance, the optimism and creativity that often characterize youth can lead to positive social and societal change. At the same time, though, young people often struggle to be taken seriously, even when their actions and ideas are good ones. Through examining several historic and contemporary case studies, this course will explore both the triumphs and terrors of youth (i.e., teens-twenties). What risks are uniquely available to young people? Which ones are rewarded and which end in regret? How might these outcomes be mediated by other factors (e.g., race, gender, sexuality)? Most importantly, what can we learn from the triumphant and terrible behaviors of others? As we explore answers to these questions through discussion, reading, and writing assignments, we'll also take advantage of your own uniquely youthful status as first-quarter, first-year students.

The class is practical in that it centers on in-class writing workshops that simulate interactions you are likely to experience during your tutoring work. The course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing teaching each other writing in the classroom, Practical Rhetoric seeks to: prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process; cultivate the necessary skills to work productively and compassionately with writers from different backgrounds and for whom English is not their first language; and provide resources and techniques for working on papers and genres of writing outside of your majors and comfort zones.\n\nIn the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a personal literacy narrative. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research project, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. Lastly, the course asks you to visit the Writing Place as writers yourselves, reflecting on what your experiences as the student being tutored teach you about yourself as both a tutor and a writer. \n\nIn addition to completing all of the graded elements of this course, students enrolled in Practical Rhetoric are required to work for at least 3 hours/week in the Writing Place. You will be paid for these (and any additional weekly hours) you work."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"TBD"}]}],"001791":[{"unique_id":"18959","instructors":["James Richard O'Laughlin"],"mode":null,"title":"Advanced Composition","subject":"ENGLISH","number":"305-0","section":"1","meeting_days":"MoWeFr","start_time":"15:00","end_time":"15:50","room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course is designed to help you find your own voice, write more effectively with an awareness of who you are writing for, and write increasingly complex pieces.\n\nThere will be brief writing exercises and three essays: one short (3-5 pp.), one slightly longer (5-6 pp.), and one still longer (10 pp) that will involve some research on a topic of your own choosing.

But all of these endeavors, though often entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas, and can have unintended consequences. In this course, students will explore and consider these ethical challenges. In so doing, students will examine core global bioethical concerns - such as structural violence - and core global bioethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as beneficence and solidarity - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the central goal of global health: reducing health inequities and disparities. With an emphasis on the ethical responsibility to reduce disparities, we consider some of the most pressing global bioethical issues of our time: equity, fairness, and climate change.

How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others?

This expansion has been echoed by locals, who are also providing voluntary labor in a variety of locales throughout their communities. This class explores the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of professional practitioners both promoting and critiquing this apparent rise in \"the need to help\". What boons and burdens occur with the boom of volunteer fervor world-wide? Why do people feel the need to volunteer, and what consequences do these voluntary exchanges have on the volunteers, and on those communities and institutions that are subject to their good intentions? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" amongst differently-situated players who are involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics that justify philanthropy and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? This class seeks out some answers to these questions, and highlights why the increased concern for strangers that undergirds volunteering should also be, in itself, cause for our concern."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Pre-registration open to Global Health Studies majors and minors only.

Do the poems describe a largely imaginary realm created by their author, or do they reflect a particular period of ancient Greek history?and if so, which one? This course explores the society, economy, and culture of Iron Age Greece with special emphasis on the Geometric and early Archaic periods, emphasizing what scholars have learned through archaeological discoveries along with study of the poems themselves. Topics include the excavations at Troy, Athens, and other sites; contacts with Egypt and the Near East and colonization in the Mediterranean world; trade, exchange, and the technology of travel; literacy and oral tradition; political communities and warfare; religion, burial practices, and the art of ritual and commemoration."}]}],"017850":[{"unique_id":"18786","instructors":["Kevin Gerard Boyle","Laura Rebecca Brueck"],"mode":null,"title":"Humanities in the World I","subject":"HUM","number":"210-0","section":"40","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Meets in Non-General PurposeRm"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"18787","instructors":["Tracy L Vaughn","Miriam Joanna Petty"],"mode":null,"title":"Humanities in the World I","subject":"HUM","number":"210-0","section":"50","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Meets in Non-General PurposeRm"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"017871":[{"unique_id":"18788","instructors":["Leslie Maria Harris","Tristram Nash Wolff"],"mode":null,"title":"Humanities in the World II","subject":"HUM","number":"211-0","section":"30","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Meets in Non-General PurposeRm"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"020932":[{"unique_id":"18789","instructors":["James Joseph Hodge"],"mode":null,"title":"Media Theory","subject":"HUM","number":"225-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"12:20","room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Media Theory: An Introduction\n\nHow do media impact our sense of such fundamental concepts as personhood, time and space, and social life?

That movement is part of a long history of Native activism. In this course, we will examine the individual and collective ways in which Indigenous people have resisted colonial domination in the U.S. and Canada since 1887.

At the conclusion of the course, the student should be able to know what it takes to write a successful research assignment not only in philosophy, but quite generally in academic contexts.

In this process, they will also learn to apply these (=our) ideals reflectively and critically on contemporary challenges to democratic practice like elite domination, racism and populism.

The classical writings of Peirce, James, Dewey set the stage for a completely new orientation in epistemology, moral and political theory, psychology and many other fields. Basic to all Pragmatist writers is the belief that the active and interactive human being in its natural and social environment has to stand at the center of reflection. They thus emphasize volitional, procedural, social, and evolutionary aspects of knowledge of any kind. Given this focus on practically involved intelligent agents, political pragmatists like Dewey, Addams, Locke explore the natural origins, revisability and legitimacy of moral and political norms. They develop the idea of a critical use of knowledge and its connection to non-violent democratic conduct. Neopragmatists (Rorty and Putnam) explore the philosophical and political implications of critical thinking."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"1) Students will become competent in the basic texts in the pragmatist philosophical literature from Peirce to Putnam. \n2) Students will acquire an enhanced sensitivity for method, logical analysis of theoretical and practical complexes and their connection, as well as an increased expertise in the close written and oral analysis of complex thoughts and textual sources. \n3) One of the central aims will be, following the central topic of pragmatist thought, to offer students a complete reflective awareness of the structure of problem-solving behavior in cognitive, scientific, ethical and cultural affairs, and to train them in applying this competency to cases.\n 4) Students will acquire an awareness of the close connections between 'theoretical' positions and political conditions."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Attendance\nClass participation\nFinal Paper\nPapers"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"A course reader will be available for purchase at Quartet."},{"name":"Class Materials (Suggested)","desc":"HS Thayer: Pragmatism: the Classic Writings ISBN: 978-0915145379\n\nReader:\n\nMorris, Charles: \"The Occasion for American Pragmatism \", in Morris, C., The Pragmatic Movement in American Philosophy, New York: G.Braziller 1979, 3-15.\n\nPeirce, Charles S.: \"Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man\", in vol.

We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media.

The focus will be on the practical skills and knowledge required to design and teach a successful undergraduate course in psychology. Many of the assignments for this course are designed to result in material that can be used in a professional teaching portfolio when applying for faculty positions. Topics will include course design and creating an effective syllabus; methods of assessment; grading and feedback; writing and delivering engaging lectures; leading meaningful class discussions; designing and evaluating activities and assignments; building more inclusive classrooms; and working with challenging students. In this course, students will develop and articulate their own statements of teaching philosophy; create a course syllabus; observe and evaluate classes taught by master teachers; create exams and assignments; and practice giving lectures. We will focus on practical issues that commonly arise in undergraduate psychology courses and best practices for teaching difficult concepts in psychology. This course is meant to compliment other resources available on campus, such as those offered by the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching. All course readings will be available on Canvas. This course will meet once per week.

Two to three class presentations, with brief paper\nThe idea is to summarize and critique the assigned articles.\n\nPaper. Two-to-four pages. The text should briefly summarize the article and raise discussion points. Be sure to include key graphs, tables, and sample stimuli. Draw new tables or diagrams if necessary. Bring enough copies for the class on the day you present.\n\nPresentation. 15-20 minutes, plus 15 minutes of discussion. The presentation\nshould include:\n\nA. A brief summary of the author's theoretical concerns and the methods, results, and conclusions. Show samples of the materials and tables/graphs of results.\n\nB. A brief critical discussion of the article, including both negatives (problems with the reasoning, dubious assumptions, question-begging, etc.) and positives?overall significance, further implications, etc.\n\nC. A set of discussion questions for the class.\n\nNOTE: You should normally use power point or such for showing materials and results. If you have more than 10-15 slides, your talk is too long. I may truncate it mercilessly if it goes on too long.\n\nPlease check at least a week before to be sure the readings for your week are available to the class. Let  (cogsci@northwestern.edu) and me know in time to fix it if they are not.\n\n\n2. Weekly reaction bulletin: Each week, you must turn in a one-page reaction to at least two of the readings. This should not be just a summary?it's a way for you to discuss further implications and issues. Sometimes I'll assign specific questions to be addressed.\n\n3. Term Paper: A roughly 12-15-page paper. This should contain a review of the literature on some topic, oriented around some claim or question, plus a proposal for testing it? e.g., a psychological experiment, a linguistic corpus analysis, or a computer simulation. Lay out the possible outcomes and what their theoretical implications would be. Pilot data is good to include. DON'T just write a ?flame' paper; discuss the relevant literature intelligently -- both from course readings and from other papers you find.\n\nFor the literature you cover, it's fine to draw on the papers we've read in class, but you should also find some other work that we didn't cover. Aim for 6-10 new references. When you send your proposal (see point 4), I'll suggest some relevant readings.\n\n4. Proposal: About 2-3 weeks before your term paper is due, you should give me a proposal outlining what your topic and main issue, along with some sample references you plan to use. This will let me give you feedback on relevant work, etc.\n\n5. Quiz grades: Quizzes may be given at any time. This is particularly likely to happen if students seem not to be doing the readings or participating actively in discussion"}]}],"002961":[{"unique_id":"18892","instructors":["Galen V

Do we set out to mold reality to our vision or accept it as it is? How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Cervantes, Miguel de.

We will seek to understand (a) the cultural and political practices through which Spaniards have understood themselves in relation to other peoples and places over time; and (b) how scholars have constituted \"Spain\" and \"Spanish culture\" as objects of knowledge over time. Thus, rather than attempting a comprehensive survey of \"Spain\" or \"Spanish culture,\" we will examine several key historical moments and themes that have shaped contemporary Spanish society and politics. Throughout, our focus will be trained on how knowledge about Spain is produced and consumed, and how that knowledge is mobilized in the present by a wide range of people, institutions, and projects. Although our readings will be grounded in anthropology, we will also draw on other disciplines (history, philosophy, and cultural studies) and various media (music, podcasts, and film), as well as the unpredictable unfolding of current events. Thinking together, we will discuss why and how \"Spain\" matters in the world and for us."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Previous coursework either in Spanish or Anthropology is strongly encouraged, but not required."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:\n?
