What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making?  How might the conventions of journalism?the traditional rules and practices that guide our work?be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized?pitting identifiable groups against each other?in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term \"fake news\" has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe.  Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging \"fake news\" are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process.  How have we been complicit?  What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference? What is the public responsibility in achieving a degree of literacy, particularly with increasing reliance on social media?

The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter. \n\nOur work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new? \n\nThis is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism. \n\nThe course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway. \n\nEach week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet. We'll regularly hear directly from writers and editors, in person and via Zoom or Skype.

We often study legal ethics through the use of hypothetical problems that are intended to raise vexing issues for practicing lawyers.  Even in sophisticated simulations (such as those used at Northwestern), however, it is nearly impossible to duplicate the exigencies, pressures, and conflicting demands experienced by contemporary lawyers.  Studies of the legal profession are also often one step removed (at least) from actual law practice, based on surveys or aggregations of information that do not address the actions of individuals.\n\nLawyer (and judge) memoirs may be the means to bridge this gap, providing an opportunity to explore the ways in which individuals assume roles, make compromises, and seek solutions to daily problems in law firms and in courts.  Of course, most memoirs are self-serving (when they are not self-aggrandizing), so they will have to be read with much skepticism.  But that will be revealing as well, as we will be able to consider the most common rationalizations that are used to excuse -- and sometimes glorify -- questionable choices and conduct.\n\nSome memoirists are painfully introspective, some appear to be blinded by ego, and others are surprisingly na?ve.  In combination, I believe this literature can be the basis for some true insights into the way law is, and should be, practiced."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"By the end of the semester, students will have learned to read texts closely for insights into an author's world view, including those revealed both intentionally and unintentionally.

Unless you are instructed otherwise, please prepare each assignment according to your  \"A\" or \"B\" designation.  You will retain your designation for the entire semester.

Accordingly, all students and instructors may make objections at any time during any problem session.  To raise an objection you must stand and state your legal grounds.\n\n\nC.\tCritique\n\nAt various times during each class session the student performances will be critiqued by the faculty.  The purpose of critique is to help you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your own performance, with an eye toward future improvement.  Our goal in critique is not to criticize you either as an advocate or a person, but rather to alert you to any mistakes and to make specific and forward-looking suggestions.\n\nPlease be aware that on a faculty of over 50 trial lawyers there are bound to be diverging points of view -- not to mention outright disputes -- as to how any particular exercise ought to be approached.  Do not be frustrated when you receive contradictory advice from different instructors.

CCR is one of the nation's largest and longest running community mediation centers.  It provides extensive mediation services in Chicago through the Cook County court system and community-based referrals (www.ccrchicago.org).  As part of this professional training, all students must attend a mandatory weekend training session on September 18, 2021.\n\nStudents certified as CCR mediators will be eligible to conduct actual mediations on behalf of CCR in the 4 credit hour mediation practicum during the Spring semester (LITARB 676).  Certification as a CCR mediator is determined by a committee of CCR trainers and is based on a student's ability to successfully complete a series of simulated mediations and demonstrate mastery of CCR's mediation model.  Students interested in pursuing certification must attend the additional training session taking place September 19, September 25, October 2, 2021.\n\nIn addition to the training held by CCR, students pursuing certification may be required to do other activities and simulations inside and outside of class in order to meet certification requirements. Students are expected to make all reasonable efforts, including but not limited to, finding role players, participating in simulations and role plays, and completing suggested exercises, in order to meet the certification standard by November 15.

Students in this class will engage in real-life and class-based learning. During the semester, students will work with non-lawyers at a community-based or change-oriented organization. \"Change-oriented\" means any organization working actively to move the needle on a particular issue or set of issues. Students are free to select an organization that aligns with their interests, but the organization needs to be approved by the professor, so reach out to her as soon as possible. The professor is also willing to help you find an organization that would specifically interest you or allow you to select an organization in need of help that she has available. You should begin looking for an organization prior to the start of the semester, since you should have the organization finalized by the first week of class.\n\nThrough this course, students will engage in discussions on real-life issues impacting different communities and will have the opportunity to speak with community leaders and advocates who are working to create change in their own communities. Topics to be covered in this course include: organizing and different theories of change, the tools and strategies of lawyers working for change, the history of lawyers working with different movements and communities, and how race, class, and power affect particular movements and your work. There are also weeks when we discuss whatever topics students suggest. Class discussion will be based on the assignments, student suggested topics, and your experiences at your community-based or change-oriented organizations. Guest speakers will join us throughout the semester. In the past, they have included communications experts, organizers, nonprofit leaders, and lawyers working for change.\n\nThe final grade will be based approximately on the following three components:\n\n(1) Final Project with 40 Volunteer Hour Requirement (60%): While working with a community-based or change-oriented organization, students will develop and complete a final project that will support their organization in their efforts to create change. The final project may consist of one deliverable or a set of deliverables that the organization would find useful in their efforts to advance change. A substantive part of the deliverable(s) will be in writing, but there is no specific page requirement because the length may depend on your organization's needs. \n\nThe deliverable(s) can take a variety of forms and combinations, and the professor is happy to discuss possibilities and confirm whether any tentative project will meet the course criteria. Some examples of different parts of prior student deliverables are: strategizing with community members and different stakeholders on how to identify and resolve particular issues, crafting the message of a campaign, doing issue research, reviewing and analyzing pending legislation, attending legislative sessions, writing press releases or different types of articles, surveying and interviewing community members and different stakeholders, preparing a report on pertinent issues, creating fact sheets and manuals, planning events, and conducting \"know your rights\" presentations for particular communities. \n\nThroughout the semester, students will have small assignments (e.g., final project proposal, outline, and first draft) that will be possibly graded on completion, in order to check-in on the progress of the final project. Additionally, students will participate in Peer Feedback Workshops, which involve students presenting an overview of their final project and work with their organization to the class. The Peer Feedback Workshops will be an opportunity for classmates to ask questions, share solutions, and learn from each other regarding the issues that each student is working on during the semester.\n\nStudents will work with non-lawyers at their community-based or change-oriented organization for a minimum of 40 volunteer hours during the semester. Students will keep track of the hours they have spent assisting their organization and provide a brief, general description of how they spent their time. They will submit their time log with their final project assignments throughout the semester. All time spent toward the creation of the deliverable(s) and working with the organization in any other way (e.g., attending meetings) will count towards fulfilling the students' 40 volunteer hour requirement. The 40 volunteer hour requirement is not a separate component from the final project. \n\n(2) Class Attendance and Participation (30%): Every week students will have assignments relating to the course topics. Weekly assignments may include preparing the graded assignments, doing short readings, watching relevant videos, writing down your goals for the semester, or finding a moving message for a campaign. At times, this content will be provided by the guest speakers. Students are expected to come prepared to speak about the assigned materials for the week and to share their experiences working with their organizations. \n\n(3) Short Reflection Paper (10%): In addition, students will be assigned one short reflection paper, and students can select from a multitude of prompts to reflect upon their work with their organization relative to different themes examined in this course.\n\nIf you have questions about any aspect of the course, please contact the professor by email: m-llorente@law.northwestern.edu. The professor is willing and eager to answer any questions about the course, and she is interested in your feedback and suggestions."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"In this course, you will: (1) Research and locate an organization with whom you would be interested in working with to create change; (2) Develop and complete a project that would primarily be of interest to that organization but also interest you and be within your abilities or abilities that you are looking to develop; (3) Connect with other stakeholders in the area where you want to make a change, learn how to develop and expand those relationships, and figure out how to best engage with and support other stakeholders; (4) Learn about theories of change, tools, strategies, and other elements used in a campaign to make change happen; (5) Evaluate and determine which theory of change, tools, strategies, and other elements would be most effective to accomplish a particular type of change; (6) Examine and engage with important topics and issues relating to race, class, power, trauma, and any other areas that we decide to explore; (7) Develop legal and other professional skills relating to making change happen, such as messaging and communications; (8) Engage in and apply self-reflection to your work; and (9) Explore and start planning for who you want to be as a lawyer and as a person ? doing what, where, and how."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"The final grade will be based approximately upon the following three components: \n(1) FINAL PROJECT (60%): Proposal (5%), Outline (5%), Peer Feedback Workshop (15%), First Draft (5%), and Final Draft (30%); \n(2) CLASS ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION (30%); AND \n(3) SHORT REFLECTION PAPER (10%).

Working with an Ethiopian NGO and a number of U.S. and Canadian partner NGOs, we'll be continuing advocacy efforts on behalf of an indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination (mercury, arsenic, etc.) from the Lega Dembi gold mine.  Details of what we'll do depend on evolving circumstances, but we may write submissions to UN human rights mechanisms, continue our efforts to force the government to make public the results of impact assessments, seek to utilize European laws and regulations with respect to the supply chain obligations of the Swiss refinery that has purchased the gold from this mine, and explore possibilities within the African HR system.\n2.  We have been asked by two women's rights NGOs in Myanmar to analyze the results of a survey questionnaire on the security situation of women in Myanmar following the military coup, to write a report based on these results, and to engage in international advocacy using the report.  Please understand that this project may be canceled or delayed if either the security situation or the pandemic make it impossible for our NGO partners to proceed at this time; I am hopeful, though, that we will be able to move forward on this.\n3.  Working with the newly-founded Geneva-based International Platform for Corporate Liability, we will continue work begun last year to research whether grounds exist to hold corporate actors in the gold and diamond sectors criminally liable for complicity in crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic.\n4. With luck, we may be able to resume clinic travel this fall.  I am hopeful that some of us will be able to attend the UN Forum on Business & HR in November, and there is a small possibility we may be able to return to Addis Ababa to continue our work with our colleagues in Ethiopia.  Of course, this will be dependent on the pandemic situation.\n5.  We may add another project - perhaps in collaboration with a legal clinic in either Arequipa, Peru, or Tbilisi, Georgia, or in collaboration with an LGBTQ+ NGO in Sri Lanka that my clinic has worked with in the past.\n6.

For roughly the first two-thirds the course, we'll talk about the basics: the requirements for copyright validity; limitations on copyright protection; the elements of copyright infringement; the various types of copyright infringement; defenses to infringement; and remedies. For the remaining third of the course, we'll talk about more specialized topics such as formalities, moral rights, music industry regulation, and software copyright. We will use a free casebook that is available for free download online. We will do in-class exercises regularly."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"There are no pre-reqs for Copyright. If you have taken Intellectual Property or plan to take it concurrently, there will be some minimal repetition.

In particular, students will see how technology has long caused significant changes in the creative industries and led copyright law to respond. They will also understand the reverse dynamic in which copyright law has sometimes shaped the course of business and technology."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"80% exam, 20% class participation and attendance"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"We will be using a free online casebook: COPYRIGHT LAW: CASES AND MATERIALS (v.3.0) by Jeanne C.

You can access the entire book through the web at https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/maize/mpub9798641.\n \nRather than purchasing a statutory supplement, I recommend that you refer to the copyright statute online. Two good online sources are the Copyright Office's website and the Legal Information Institute's website.\n\nI will also assign or recommend law review articles, short excerpts from treatises, other casebooks, or supplemental cases.

Students will sight read literature with varying amounts of preparation (2 minutes, 1 day, or several days).  These experiences will serve to identify areas that require concrete, practical strategies to strengthen weak skills that will eventually become important resources in the student's development of their vocal- and choral-pedagogical identity.

Theoretical perspectives will be explored in relation to empirical research, field studies, first person accounts, and imaginative works.  Special emphasis will be given to the adolescent's subjective experience and to the remembered accounts of our own adolescence.

It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation.\n\nThe first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents."}]}],"000652":[{"unique_id":"19583","instructors":["Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach"],"mode":null,"title":"Economics of Social Policy","subject":"SOC_POL","number":"330-0","section":"20","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"015787":[{"unique_id":"14955","instructors":["James Edward   Rosenbaum"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics in Social Policy","subject":"SOC_POL","number":"351-0","section":"21","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"19584","instructors":["Tabitha   Bonilla"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics in Social Policy","subject":"SOC_POL","number":"351-0","section":"22","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"As understanding of identity and bias increased, Kimberle Crenshaw developed the theory of intersectionality which challenges us to consider various components of identities as having the potential to create overlapping and intersecting experiences. When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"No First-Years\nMethodology Class Preferred"}]}],"017367":[{"unique_id":"14966","instructors":["Timothy Scott Hayes","Corrie L Cockrell"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Social Contexts of Education","subject":"TEACH_ED","number":"302-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"18:00","end_time":"21:00","room":null,"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"19594","instructors":["Elizabeth Rose Shulman","Marcus Arthur Campbell"],"mode":"Synchronous","title":"Social Contexts of Education","subject":"TEACH_ED","number":"302-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"18:00","end_time":"21:00","room":null,"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"022441":[{"unique_id":"14967","instructors":[],"mode":null,"title":"Speech & Communication in the School Environment","subject":"TEACH_ED","number":"309-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Mo","start_time":"18:30","end_time":"21:30","room":null,"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"008037":[{"unique_id":"14962","instructors":["Timothy A.

Trends towards empowerment, digitization, and globalization have resulted in organizations that routinely structure work around teams. Teams connect diverse, distributed individuals, empowering them to work collaboratively. Those working in, leading, and studying teams have repeatedly observed that teams can accomplish more than the sum or member capabilities (i.e., synergy), but often accomplish less than would the same individuals working alone (i.e., process loss). This course will explore the forces that affect behavior in teams, and the factors that lead to team success. The course will explore the specific challenges associated with leading teams, some of which include: building and designing teams, managing information sharing within and across teams, structuring effective group decision processes, igniting creative thinking, enabling complex problem solving, managing team diversity and conflict, and managing teams of teams.

Theoretical articulation of the \"public sphere\" has directed critical understanding of key institutions in modern societies, including the liberal-democratic state, capitalist social relations, the media and culture industries, and social movement protest. Critique also has identified a full range of deep problems in public formations, from whether publics are ineffectual fictions to how conceptions of public identity operate as means of exclusion and oppression. This seminar will introduce the students to systematic exploration of \"the public\" as it is a network of concepts and an historical development extending into the era of digital media technologies.

During the years surrounding World War II she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization. In 1965 Dunham settled in East St. Louis, where she trailblazed methods for using the arts to engage and uplift youth in the community.  \n  \nThe class time will be split between movement and discussion.

While many writers assert that the capability to nurture networks will differentiate dominant 21st century organizations, little is known about how this important organizational form emerges and evolves.\n\nThis seminar is intended to review theoretical, conceptual, and analytic issues associated with network perspectives on communicating and organizing. The course will review scholarship on the science of networks in communication, computer science, economics, engineering, organizational science, life sciences, physical sciences, political science, psychology, and sociology in order to take an in-depth look at theories, methods, and tools to examine the structure and dynamics of networks.\n\nMost class time will be spent discussing the assigned readings.

This has produced a distinct vision within our field of what communication is, how it functions, and what normative ideas it should uphold. It theorizes communication from one specific standpoint, but then generalizes that standpoint to generate supposedly universal truths. This course aims to break free of this vision and the constraints it places on both our understandings of the world and our own theorizing. To do so, it assembles a \"new canon\" of germinal research in communication studies on race, nation, gender, and sexuality. These works do not merely theorize different forms of alterity that have been ignored or disregarded by the mainstream of the field, but rather theorize from alterity to challenge the field's foundational assumptions. These works help us develop a new vision of what communication is, how it functions, and what normative ideas it should uphold by forcing us to approach these questions from outside the assumptions of whiteness, cis-ness, maleness, heterosexuality, and Euroamericanness."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"No textbook required."}]},{"unique_id":"19257","instructors":["Aymar Christian Jean"],"mode":null,"title":"Special Topics Research Seminar","subject":"MTS","number":"525-0","section":"26","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"15:00","end_time":"17:50","room":{"building_name":"Frances Searle Building 3417"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"How do sexuality, race, gender, and class shape new media?

We will explore how storytelling performances reflect our families, communities, culture, and nation. To engage the power and significance of storytelling performance we will focus on three units:  (1) Oral Narrative. Students will learn how to conduct in-depth interviews, on a particular topic, to gather oral narratives and their meanings from specific family, friends, or community members. (2) Myth. Students will read and discuss ancient and contemporary myths to unravel deeper questions about local and global experiences. (3) News Reports. Through guided instruction students will select a current news story, from electronic or newspaper journalism, they feel reveals an urgent issue they are compelled to share. Each of the three units will culminate in a performance: a solo performance of an oral narrative, a group performance of a myth and, finally, a multi-media group performance of a news story. The course is highly interactive and performance based. The unifying thread and overarching question for the course is: How does storytelling performance and creative communication help us better engage and illuminate our world and the world of others, e.g., identity, family, community, nation, social relations, political institutions and economic orders?"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"materials will be made available to students on Canvas or at the library at no cost"}]},{"unique_id":"19007","instructors":[],"mode":"Hybrid","title":"Performance Culture and Communication","subject":"PERF_ST","number":"203-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"9:00","end_time":"10:50","room":{"building_name":"Annie May Swift Hall 103"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"004171":[{"unique_id":"15109","instructors":["Patricia A Akinbola"],"mode":"Hybrid","title":"Topics in Performance Studies","subject":"PERF_ST","number":"330-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Th","start_time":"13:00","end_time":"15:50","room":{"building_name":"Annie May Swift Hall 103"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]},{"unique_id":"15334","instructors":["Joshua Wade Rains"],"mode":"Hybrid","title":"Topics in Performance Studies","subject":"PERF_ST","number":"330-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"Fr","start_time":"12:00","end_time":"14:50","room":{"building_name":"Meets in Non-General PurposeRm"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"004176":[{"unique_id":"19006","instructors":["Cristal Chanelle Truscott Gray"],"mode":"Face to face","title":"Studies in Performance","subject":"PERF_ST","number":"410-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"We","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"13:50","room":{"building_name":"Annie May Swift Hall 103"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course focuses on the theory and artistry of public performance.

Throughout television's history the medium has experimented with ongoing or cumulative narrative storytelling. The definition of the term seriality, however, remains ever contested even while key features remain obvious or rather taken for granted. One such feature is that serial television has characters who grow or evolve over seasons and years, rather than remain static and unchanged. Another key feature is that the stories serial television tell are meant to be ongoing with episodes building upon each other in a cumulative narrative. Furthermore, some scholars even argue that series that employ seriality are uniquely primed to tackle more complex and nuanced social and representational issues. This course then seeks to both define television seriality while also taking a historical approach in detailing key moments throughout the medium's development and evolution. The course relies heavily on the foundational work of feminist media scholars' whose perspectives and contributions on seriality remain important for any understanding of the television narrative format. We will start with primetime soap operas like Peyton's Place (ABC 1964-1969) and Dallas (CBS 1978-1991) whose novelistic or continuing drama approaches are indebted to the maligned and feminized soap opera format. We will explore hybrid narrative approaches like that of crime dramas and police procedurals including Dragnet (NBC 1951-1959) and one of the longest running series of its kind Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (NBC 1999-).

Taking a unique perspective that combines cultural studies with fan studies, media\nindustry studies, and theories of space/place, it invites students to make two critical moves:\nFirst, through an introduction to concepts that frame digital media and participatory culture in\nspatial terms, we will learn to think spatially about our digital media environment and participatory\nconsumption. Through these concepts, students will be invited to analyze how media industries\nuse spatial logics to design their media platforms, organize user experiences, encourage fan\nengagement, and protect their intellectual property. Second, to think about how digital media\ntechnologies and logics are being mapped onto and transforming the physical spaces we find ourselves in.\nTo make this connection, we'll travel to a wide range of places where audiences are being\nactively called to \"go out\" and \"have an experience\" in branded media worlds. As we move\nacross various sites of today's \"experience economy\"?from movie theaters to theme parks, fan\nconventions, escape rooms, film tourism destinations, AR/VR experiences, pop-up themed\nrestaurants, among others?we will interrogate a number of key tensions, including themes of\ninclusion vs. exclusion, industry power vs. fan power, ephemerality (experience) vs. archive\n(data collection), and play vs. labor.\nThough our primary focus will be on space-based experiences built around popular media\nfranchises, students will be encouraged to pursue topics that spark them. In addition to\ntraditional screenings, \"screening\" time will be dedicated to engagement with mobile apps and\ngames, a trip to the VR Lab on campus, and collaborative activities. Throughout the course,\nstudents will be responsible for submitting weekly memos where they relate the course material\nto their own ongoing research and experiences. Students will choose from multiple final project\noptions?creating their own space-based media experience based on a media property of their\nchoosing, drafting a policy paper, or performing a spatial analysis of a site of their choosing.\nStudents will thus leave the course not only with a critical toolkit for understanding their digital\nmedia consumption practices, but also with experience analyzing, designing, and advocating\nfor particular kinds of media spaces in the world."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Students will be able to:\n? identify the key concepts, debates, and practices of both contemporary media convergence\nand media tourism.\n? recognize how processes of digitization, conglomeration, and globalization affect the way\nmedia experiences are constructed for, marketed to, and enjoyed by contemporary\naudiences.\n? assess and discuss how questions of race, gender, class, and symbolic/economic power\nimpact the relationship between media spaces and their audiences.\n? apply and extend course concepts to other aspects of culture and lived experience.\n? demonstrate metacognition by reflecting on their learning experience throughout the term.\n? create collaborative multimodal projects, including podcasts, spatial analyses, and original\nplace-based media experiences."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"class participation, weekly lectures and reading discussions, experiential\nlearning, screenings and game demos, self-guided and project-based learning."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"All required readings and materials will be available via CANVAS at no\nadditional cost.

In this seminar, we will explore what possibilities exist within these fields to address these absences.

Essence work also enables all artists to contribute more deeply to the creative process, and to take greater ownership over the production. \n \nIn addition to a close investigation of Essence Work, students will study the artistic processes and techniques employed by innovative artists like choreographers Twyla Tharp and Pina Bausch. This course is an opportunity to expand your understanding of and experience with non-traditional rehearsal methods and techniques.

In 2020 the scale and longevity of Black Lives Matter was such that the New York Times referred to it as the largest social movement in US history. Certainly, there had been nothing like it since the anti-colonial movements and civil rights movements of the late 1950s and mid-1960s or the Black power movement of the 1970s, all of which had reverberations and replications among different Black populations across the world (e.g. Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean). This course seeks to introduce students to the historical and political underpinnings of issues and questions raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, examining their meaning in relation to Black politics and as part of what Cedric Robinson famously referred to as the Black Radical Tradition. Students will be encouraged to think about the importance of the relation between history and theory in engaging with the formations of Slavery, Colonialism and Racism; as well as developing understandings of Black political thought in relation to movements that include, Black Marxism, Black Liberalism, Black Power, Black Feminism, Black Lives Matter, Afropessimism, Black Anarchism and Afrofuturism."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Cedric Robinson, 1983/2000, Black Marxism - The Making of the Black Radical Tradition, The University of North Carolina Press..\nAdom Getachew, 2019, Worldmaking after Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination, Princeton University Press. \nRichard Iton, 2008, In Search of the Black Fantastic: Politics and Popular Culture in the Post-Civil Rights Era, Oxford University Press."}]},{"unique_id":"18565","instructors":["Ahmad T Greene-Hayes"],"mode":null,"title":"Topics in African-American Studies","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"380-0","section":"21","meeting_days":"TuTh","start_time":"15:30","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Locy Hall 106"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course examines the current state of the field of Black Studies, by way of weekly close readings of a select group of journal articles and books published in Black Studies in the last five years (2016-2021).

Given the demands of this movement, Black scholars in Black Studies have rightly sought to contend with this social, cultural, and political moment in conversation with the longstanding genealogy of Black Studies scholarship that has narrated and brought to the fore the stories of Black life, Black death, and Black political struggle. As a result, new and exciting debates have emerged and re-emerged in the field and this course examines these debates in the last five years with an eye towards slavery and its multifaceted afterlives; gender, sexuality, and racialization; blackness, the human, and the animal; social life and social death; blackness, geographies, and ecologies; and the distinctions drawn by Black scholars concerning what constitutes the category of \"critical\" Black Studies."}]}],"001221":[{"unique_id":"17281","instructors":["Tracy L Vaughn"],"mode":null,"title":"Internship in African-American Studies","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"396-0","section":"20","meeting_days":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"room":{"building_name":"TBA"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[]}],"018093":[{"unique_id":"18572","instructors":["Mary E Pattillo"],"mode":null,"title":"Research Seminar in Black Studies","subject":"AF_AM_ST","number":"401-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"Tu","start_time":"14:00","end_time":"16:50","room":{"building_name":"Crowe 5-138 Af Am Studies Sem"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"This course examines multiple approaches to undertaking Black Studies research and equips students to execute a scholarly agenda with deliberate attention to methods of data collection and analysis.

We will seek to understand (a) the cultural and political practices through which Spaniards have understood themselves in relation to other peoples and places over time; and (b) how scholars have constituted \"Spain\" and \"Spanish culture\" as objects of knowledge over time. Thus, rather than attempting a comprehensive survey of \"Spain\" or \"Spanish culture,\" we will examine several key historical moments and themes that have shaped contemporary Spanish society and politics. Throughout, our focus will be trained on how knowledge about Spain is produced and consumed, and how that knowledge is mobilized in the present by a wide range of people, institutions, and projects. Although our readings will be grounded in anthropology, we will also draw on other disciplines (history, philosophy, and cultural studies) and various media (music, podcasts, and film), as well as the unpredictable unfolding of current events.

What are the activist causes around which urban Chinese have rallied despite the risk of state repression?  Given that activists risk persecution, prison, and torture, who would do this?  How do activists maintain the emotional resilience to stand up to authoritarian rule?  What are activists' tactics and strategies?  To answer these questions, we will study reporters, labor organizers, environmental activists, religious activists, lawyers, and feminist activists.\n\tMany activists oppose the authoritarian state in the name of freedom.  I have found that many urban Chinese are happy, or at least content, in their lives today.  The insight that hundreds of millions of people can be happy or content even though they are lacking freedom is so astonishing to me, I have begun to question my own understanding of freedom.  Is freedom a specifically Western concept?  Should the notion of freedom have universal relevance?  Should we demand of the Chinese people that they democratize?  Or is this demand Orientalist?  Or racist?  Is the demand that Chinese democratize another way of saying, \"They must become like us\"?  The Chinese Communist Party is a threat to United States democracy.  Thinking about China and acting toward China, how are we to combine the defense of our democracy and the injunction to stay clear of Orientalism?  Who is a greater threat to our democracy, the Chinese Communist Party or the Republican Party?  It turns out that we, unfortunately, cannot study Chinese activists without finding a framework to evaluate Chinese authoritarian rule in political and ethical terms.\n\tEvaluating Chinese authoritarian rule involves thinking about ourselves.  Are some Americans benefitting from authoritarian rule in China?  Is the Chinese Communist Party profitable for some Americans?  Would the United States economy collapse without Chinese poverty?  Who are we in moral, political, and ethical terms to claim the high ground and criticize the Chinese Communist Party?  It is possible to argue that Western modernity is flawed beyond rescue.  From this perspective, are we in a desperate search for an alternative modernity?  Can China be our inspiration for an alternative modernity?

We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity.

Modern techniques have allowed scientists to better study small materials, and the nanotech we read about in science fiction novels can now become real products found in our world. In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety. Regulatory bodies in the United States and around the globe have discussed the ethical and social impact of nanomaterials, and we will investigate their role is assuring the nanomaterials we use leave a positive impact on the world."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Course materials will be provided in Canvas"}]}],"022460":[{"unique_id":"17111","instructors":["Frederick J Northrup"],"mode":null,"title":"Quantitative Problem Solving in Chemistry","subject":"CHEM","number":"110-0","section":"01","meeting_days":"MoTuWeThFr","start_time":"10:00","end_time":"10:50","room":{"building_name":"Tech Institute Lecture Room 2"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"LEC","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Solution strategies for traditional word problems and their application to basic chemistry quantitative problems: dimensional analysis, chemical equations, stoichiometry, limiting reagents, gas laws, and thermochemistry.

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year.

That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion.  This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.  For example:\n\n- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure.  Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.\n\n- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.\n\nIn these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis.  You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.  \n\nChemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as means to express the daring and danger of pursuing an aspiration even if it comes at the cost of one's \"soul.\" The specter of a \"Faustian bargain\" often appears when narratives identify individuals whose inordinate achievements are both destructive and self-destructive.  The theme of Faust provides a perspective in which one must thus reflect on the highest and lowest values.\nDr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century.

We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to \"world literature\" (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation that inadvertently destroys innocent lives.

Beginning with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century debates about historical materialism and the uses of history and literary history as disciplines, we will survey the development and invocations of historicism as an approach to literary study across colonial, imperial, modernist, postcolonial, and environmental episodes in literary history. How does historicism fare in addressing diverse periods? For example, while British Victorian studies recently faced critiques of dominant tendencies toward \"positivist historicism,\" some of the most energizing work in postcolonial literary studies has been deeply historicist in inclination. How has climate change provoked new visions of historical time crossing the traditional periods? Must we continue to follow Jameson's famous injunction to \"always historicize!\" or do we rather find ourselves in a \"weak\" theoretical state of affairs by which \"we cannot not historicize?\" How do we understand Roland Barthes's claim that \"a little formalism turns one away from History, but ? a lot brings one back to it?\" What is historicism good for? What are its varieties? Where does it fall short? Readings may include works by G.W.F. Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hayden White, Susan Buck-Morss, Fredric Jameson, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Saidiya Hartman, Reinhart Koselleck, Sianne Ngai, Michael Denning, Sylvia Wynter, Lisa Lowe, Michel-Rolph Troiullot, and/or Dipesh Chakrabarty.

The seminar proposes to return to the discussion between Jean-Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot concerning the notion of \"community,\" and its relation to \"literature\" (Nancy even writes of \"literary communism\"). Nancy continued to reflect on the possible relevance of this notion in the following decades, including his experience of the recent pandemic. At the core of the discussion is the question of what can form the basis of the \"common\" that is the root of all \"community\" as well as of the other words mentioned, and to what extent it necessarily implies an irreducible dimension of separation -- of which the experience of reading and writing \"literary texts\" might be an exemplary instance."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"To reflect on the relation of \"separation\" to \"community\" and \"communication\" both in general and in particular as related to the reading and writing of literary texts."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"The Seminar will be held both in person (in Paris) and via Zoom."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Final"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Maurice Blanchot, The Unavowable Community (Station Hill Press,\n1988); French, La communaut? unavouable (Editions de Minuit,\n1983) Jean-Luc Nancy, The Inoperative Community (Univ. of\nMinnesota Press, 1991: Fremcj.

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance.

Also, at the end of every problem set I will ask you a couple questions that will help you think about a potential research idea based on the concepts covered in the problem set.

In this course, we will focus on works of fiction and autobiography that pay special attention to the role that college plays in that journey. These works portray the formative childhood influences and conflicts that shape the protagonists. In the chapters on college, they dramatize the different ways that higher education helps the characters navigate the difficult and confusing task of taking control of their lives and coming to a deeper understanding of who they are and what they want from life. In each work, we also get to see the impact of their college experiences after the characters have graduated and entered the so-called \"real world.\" The works explore such questions as: Does college change who you are or, rather, help you to understand who you are? How does it impact your relationships with your family? What factors contribute to success in college and beyond, and what is even meant by \"success\"? Through reflection on and discussion, you'll begin to answer those and other questions for yourself too. We will read a variety of books that include: Bread Givers, a novel about a Jewish girl struggling with poverty at the turn of the 20th century; A Particular Kind of Black Man, a novel about the child of Nigerian immigrants who faces discrimination not only from white people but from African Americans; Educated, a memoir about a girl who grows up in an isolated, rural community with almost no formal education; and other literary works. In each work, college is a turning point for the main character, helping them to mature and move forward in their lives with clearer self-understanding and sense of purpose.

Through these readings and related critical texts, we will examine the ways that such literature provides a staging ground for public controversy and emerging theories about the artistic, cultural, ethical, and scientific significance and ramifications of addiction.\n\nCourse readings/viewing will include works of fiction, journalism, and writings from the natural and social sciences as well as popular films.

The class is practical in that it centers on in-class writing workshops that simulate interactions you are likely to experience during your tutoring work. The course also focuses heavily on both classic and current theories of the teaching of writing and of writing center-specific pedagogies. We will introduce you to classic works of writing center theory while also asking you to engage in more contemporary debates and studies in the field. Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing teaching each other writing in the classroom, Practical Rhetoric seeks to: prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process; cultivate the necessary skills to work productively and compassionately with writers from different backgrounds and for whom English is not their first language; and provide resources and techniques for working on papers and genres of writing outside of your majors and comfort zones.\n\nIn the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a personal literacy narrative. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research project, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place. Lastly, the course asks you to visit the Writing Place as writers yourselves, reflecting on what your experiences as the student being tutored teach you about yourself as both a tutor and a writer. \n\nIn addition to completing all of the graded elements of this course, students enrolled in Practical Rhetoric are required to work for at least 3 hours/week in the Writing Place.

Readings will broaden our sense of how writers discover and develop their materials, techniques, and reshape their artistic goals as they work?in the way that the work of writing itself can shift the writer's sense of the work and of the writer's purposes. We'll examine how the complexity of writing from one body of experience and thought may lead not to a \"style\" but to a range of possible structures, stances, and processes of writing.

Beginning with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century debates about historical materialism and the uses of history and literary history as disciplines, we will survey the development and invocations of historicism as an approach to literary study across colonial, imperial, modernist, postcolonial, and environmental episodes in literary history. How does historicism fare in addressing diverse periods? For example, while British Victorian studies recently faced critiques of dominant tendencies toward \"positivist historicism,\" some of the most energizing work in postcolonial literary studies has been deeply historicist in inclination. How has climate change provoked new visions of historical time crossing the traditional periods? Must we continue to follow Jameson's famous injunction to \"always historicize!\" or do we rather find ourselves in a \"weak\" theoretical state of affairs by which \"we cannot not historicize?\" How do we understand Roland Barthes's claim that \"a little formalism turns one away from History, but ? a lot brings one back to it?\" What is historicism good for? What are its varieties? Where does it fall short? Readings may include works by G.W.F.

This introductory lecture course is designed to help students understand the relatively recent origins of many of these problems, focusing especially on the last one hundred and fifty years. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the environmental effects of urbanization, industrialization, population growth, market economies, empire-building, intercontinental warfare, energy extraction, and new technologies. They will also explore different environmental philosophies and analytic frameworks that help us make sense of historical change, including political ecology, environmental history, science studies, and world history. Finally, the course will examine a range of transnational organizations, social movements, and state policies that have attempted to address and resolve environmental problems."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"To understand the historical roots of environmental problems; to explain environmental changes over time; to analyze specific places and explore environmental problems in these areas; to learn to reason and write about the past clearly."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Short writing assignments throughout quarter; participation in class and online; final longer timeline digital essay"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"All materials will be available on Canvas and/or Perusall.\n\nOryx and Crake, Margaret Atwood, ISBN 9780385721677, (Penguin Random House, 2004)\n\nFortune Tellers: The Story of America's First Economic Forecasters, Walter Friedman, ISBN: 9780691159119 (Princeton University Press, 2014\n\nBrave New World, Aldous Huxley, ISBN: 9780060850524,  (HarperCollins, 2006 [1932])\n\nThe Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M.

She understood writing and other artistic processes as sites of formal and intellectual experimentation, transgression, and discovery; processes through which one might discover \"new values\" for use--or not-- \"after the revolution.\" Deeply entwined with her social and political thought, Duras's work forms a sustained response to the rapidly transforming social, cultural and political contexts from which it emerged, of which this class focuses on the following: World War II, the camps, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki; French colonialism, decolonization, rising immigration and colonial nostalgia; postwar Marxist and psychoanalytic feminist thought, and issues of education.

Students will be introduced to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, the social determinants of health, and biopolitics. Central questions of the seminar include: How do social categories of difference determine disease and health in individuals and collectivities? How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others? The course will provide advanced instruction in anthropological and related social scientific research methods as they apply to questions of social inequality and public health policy in both the United States and in emerging economic powers.

This expansion has been echoed by locals, who are also providing voluntary labor in a variety of locales throughout their communities. This class explores the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of professional practitioners both promoting and critiquing this apparent rise in \"the need to help\". What boons and burdens occur with the boom of volunteer fervor world-wide? Why do people feel the need to volunteer, and what consequences do these voluntary exchanges have on the volunteers, and on those communities and institutions that are subject to their good intentions? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" amongst differently-situated players who are involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics that justify philanthropy and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? This class seeks out some answers to these questions, and highlights why the increased concern for strangers that undergirds volunteering should also be, in itself, cause for our concern."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Pre-registration open to Global Health Studies majors and minors only.

What do these fictional and non-fictional accounts have to tell us about societal celebrations, anxieties and ambiguities relating to medicine?

For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as means to express the daring and danger of pursuing an aspiration even if it comes at the cost of one's \"soul.\" The specter of a \"Faustian bargain\" often appears when narratives identify individuals whose inordinate achievements are both destructive and self-destructive.  The theme of Faust provides a perspective in which one must thus reflect on the highest and lowest values.\n\nDr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century.  This class will begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend:  what is a \"soul,\" and what is worth?   While examining these and kindred questions about the nature of the self, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we evaluate a work of art in relation to the culture of its \"time\" or \"period.\"  In addition to listening to some musical compositions and reading some shorter texts, we will examine the earliest versions of Faust, which derives from the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation and then proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's great drama of cosmic knowledge and sexual seduction, Faust I, followed by selections from its strange sequel Faust II, in which Faust invents paper money and then becomes a real-estate developer or social-engineer who wants to reorganize the very nature of our planet.  We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to \"world literature\" (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation that inadvertently destroys innocent lives.  As a conclusion to our analysis of Goethe's Faust, we will read two very different kinds of poetic responses, Paul Celan's \"Death Fugue\" and Carol Ann Duffy's \"Mrs. Faust.\"  And in the final two weeks of the class we will view three versions of the Faust legend for our times, beginning with the story of the bluesman Robert Johnson, as represented in Peter Meyer's Can't You Hear the Wind Howl?, followed by Sophie Barthes' Cold Souls and concluding with Danny Boyle's Yesterday."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"No requirements; taught in English; all readings in English"},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"?\tTo gain a knowledge of a major legend of modern culture\n?\tTo gain an understanding of central European cultural history particular attention to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism.  \n?\tTo develop and expand the skills necessary for writing a critical essay on a complex literary work.\n?\tTo gain a familiarity with the difference between analyzing a literary work and cinematic one."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Writing assignments"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"History and Tale of Dr. Johannes Faustus (\"Faust Chapbook\"); Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust; selected short poems and three films, which will be available for streaming.\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust: A Tragedy, Parts One and Two, trans.

The seminar proposes to return to the discussion between Jean-Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot concerning the notion of \"community,\" and its relation to \"literature\" (Nancy even writes of \"literary communism\"). Nancy continued to reflect on the possible relevance of this notion in the following decades, including his experience of the recent pandemic. At the core of the discussion is the question of what can form the basis of the \"common\" that is the root of all \"community\" as well as of the other words mentioned, and to what extent it necessarily implies an irreducible dimension of separation -- of which the experience of reading and writing \"literary texts\" might be an exemplary instance."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"The learning objective is to reflect on the relation of \"separation\" to \"community\" and \"communication\" both in general and in particular as related to the reading and writing of literary texts.\nThe Seminar will be held both in person (in Paris) and via Zoom."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Seminar"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Class participation\nPaper, final"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Maurice Blanchot, The Unavowable Community (Station Hill Press, 1988); French, La communaut? unavouable (Editions de Minuit, 1983)\nJean-Luc Nancy, The Inoperative Community (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1991: Fremcj.

This status recognizes the distinctive cultural and political heritage of Tibet but nonetheless affirms Tibet as an integral part of China. Tibet was \"Peacefully Liberated\" by the People's Liberation Army in 1950-1951. Previously, the Republican and Qing imperial states variously claimed sovereignty or suzerainty over Tibet. Many Tibetans, whether living in Tibet or abroad, contest the historical and moral legitimacy of this rule, or question the particular arrangements that govern the place of Tibet, Tibetan people, and Tibetan language and culture as part of China's mosaic of fifty-six ethnic groups. The Dalai Lama (a Buddhist spiritual leader), and foreign supporters as diverse as Bjork and Paris Hilton, have made \"Free Tibet\" a familiar slogan and social cause. Within China such sentiments are commonly viewed as a serious attack on national integrity. This course examines competing claims regarding the national status of Tibet in light of the historically complex cultural and political relationships between Tibet and China. We will focus on the specifics of 20th c. Chinese and Tibetan nationalisms and probe the nature of nations and nationalism generally. As a famous essay we will study asks, \"What is a nation?\" We will also consider the relevance of history-based nationalist arguments concerning religious freedom, cultural autonomy, modern progress, and the nature of complex, multi-cultural nations, such as China (or, for that matter, the USA)."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"1) Gain understanding of the present-day and historical relationship between Tibet and China and the current place of Tibet in China.

The manner in which different diseases spread reflect important aspects of world history. For instance, the spread of the Black Death was dependent on the revival of long-distance trade; smallpox was spread throughout the \"new world\" by both territorial conquest and the human trafficking in slaves; cholera, which was transmitted infected water, was (and is) representative of poor hygiene and abject poverty -- factors that were often class related.

The mass murder unleashed by the Nazis was also preceded, accompanied, or followed by a massive theft of Jewish property called Aryanization, which was redistributed to numerous individual and institutional \"Aryan\" (gentile) beneficiaries. The postwar consequences of the Holocaust massive dispossession of human victims were somehow neglected by scholars, except the criminal justice efforts illustrated by the trials of Nazi perpetrators. Less was known about the other side of the postwar justice - restorative justice - namely the efforts to repair, to the extent possible, the terrible harm inflicted on the Jews and other groups of victims and their livelihoods by the Nazi genocidal regime and its collaborators. The topic of restitution and reparations started to gain more attention especially in the 1990s when the media coverages of the fate of Jewish property looted by the Nazis and their collaborators triggered the interest of scholars and the general public especially in the US, Western Europe, and Israel. This growing interest in Holocaust restitution and reparations was rooted in the opening of new archives (enabled by the collapse of the Iron Curtain), the litigation pursued by Holocaust survivors and their heirs, the spread of a globalized economy, and a growing concern for human rights and the repairing historical injustices.   \nThis course will explore the restorative justice processes that took place in the aftermath of the Holocaust, focusing particularly on the restitution of property (such as houses, businesses, art) and reparations efforts in Europe, Israel, and the US, locations which hosted the largest Jewish communities after the Holocaust. During this course we will discuss some of the main restitution and reparations events, including those related to the postwar governments' and Allies forces' efforts to return the Aryanized houses, businesses, jobs, valuables, and art objects to their former Jewish owners, the negotiations of the 1952 Reparations Agreement between West Germany and the Claims Conference, the 1990s Swiss Banks debate, and the survivors' litigation campaign in the US courts during the 1990s and 2000s. \nOur examination of the Holocaust restorative justice processes will be based primarily on historical texts of Holocaust scholars as well as on postwar documents and autobiographical accounts of Jewish survivors. In addition to such texts, we will watch excerpts from documentary films, which depict the survivors' efforts to obtain legitimate restitution and reparations."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"By completing this course, you are expected to be able to: ?\t                                                                                                                                                                       Familiarize yourselves with the major historical events of the Holocaust restorative justice we examine in class.   ?\tRead critically, understand and analyze works of history produced by scholars with different methodological and theoretical approaches to the history of the Holocaust restitution and reparation processes.  ?\tAcquire an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of the historical craft.  ?\tImprove your analytical, writing and communication skills through close readings of texts, class discussions, writing papers. ?\tLearn to recognize historical arguments regarding controversial historical questions and to formulate and support an original historical argument using primary and secondary sources.  ?\tLearn how to properly structure a thesis-driven paper, how to apply appropriate methods of citation, and how to use a clear writing style that conveys historical knowledge, ideas, and evidence in a mature, readily understood manner."},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Class active participation; research paper; presentation"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Some Measure of Justice: The Holocaust Era Restitution Campaign of the 1990s; Michael R.

In Montmartre where he eventually found a job as a busboy and occasional bouncer, he consoled Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith, the singer and dancer from New York who owned of the most popular jazz club in the neighborhood and for whose attention Cole Porter and F. Scott Fitzgerald competed.  Soon, Josephine Baker (originally from St. Louis, Missouri) would shock and delight audiences with her Revue N?gre to become the most celebrated entertainer in Paris.  While state-side, newspapers dubbed this community, the \"Harlem Renaissance Overseas,\"  Black and Brown artists, intellectuals, students, journalists and other sojourners from the United States encountered another \"exotic\" in Paris: their own counter-parts from the Caribbean and Africa.  Out of this engagement, a multi-lingual diasporic identity developed within a new internationalism.  It birthed the N?gritude movement and fostered an anti-colonial nationalist opposition that would lead de-colonization struggles in the 1950s and ?60s.  This seminar invites students to explore this extraordinary flowering of artistic and political expression.  Over the quarter, we will study the Afro-diasporic poetry, novels, painting, photography, film, music, and dance of the period as well as the political, philosophical, and social commentaries of the era.  After a broad overview, including developments in French and Parisian history in the 1920s and ?30s, students will select (with the guidance of the instructor) an area to research and write a 10 to 12 page essay based on the array of primary sources collected by the instructor.  Reading knowledge of French is not required.  The course will especially highlight the contribution of women.  In addition to 395 credit for History majors, the course is open for 350 registration for students in Gender and Sexuality Studies.

We will quickly find that if the field of early American history is a stage, its cast, setting, and plot have changed profoundly over the past several decades (as Alan Taylor observes in American Colonies).  Its starring actors used to be Englishmen on the eastern coast of North America.  Now, historians engage a more sprawling cast of characters: men and women from hundreds of ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds, who collectively inhabit an entire continent--not to mention islands and oceans.  Drawing from classic accounts as well as from more recent scholarship, we will consider the benefits and the drawbacks of these more recent approaches, and we will also debate future possibilities for the field.

dimensions of U.S. history, both on the North American continent and beyond it.

Our focus will be on what imperialism has meant for land and lives, primarily examining the mechanics of U.S. empire, and at times considering its broader and more diffuse aspects. In treating overseas empire, we will devote more attention to colonies and administered land than to the United States' economic dominance and global cultural power."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"Read and discuss historiography concerning U.S. empire"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Paul Conrad, The Apache Diaspora: Four Centuries of Displacement and Survival (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2021), ISBN: 9780812253016\n \nClaudio Saunt, Unworthy Republic: The Dispossession of Native Americans and the Road to Indian Territory (New York: W.

Focused on a single region in the United States?Lower Louisiana, East Texas, and the giant body of water that connects them?our course asks what this distinctive landscape of land and water can tell us about our place on this planet, at this moment in history. The Gulf of Mexico is emblematic of stories we tell ourselves about racial and cultural difference, climate crisis and climate vulnerability, survival and the end of the world. Through the cause of climate justice, students in the course will examine how today's political thinking pits economic and ecological priorities against each other, and against human survival. Three events of the early 21st century?the flooding of New Orleans in and after Hurricane Katrina (2005); BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010); and the flooding of the Houston, Texas area after Hurricane Harvey (2017)?show vividly how the vulnerability of contemporary life around the Gulf of Mexico is shaped by longer histories, and imagined futures, in which \"natural disaster\" and human agency can be hard to tell apart. The inextricability of racial, economic, and environmental impacts that follow such events, with their potent mix of accident and decision, neglect and care, violence and resistance, is not unique to this region: it is part of the unfolding story of the modern world. Students will work in between history, ecology, and literature in order to ground themselves in the \"environmental humanities,\" an emerging area of study that helps us see how material histories and natural ecologies intersect with literature and art.\n\nReadings may include selections from these books:\nJack Davis, The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea\nAndy Horowitz, Katrina: A History, 1915-2015\nEugenie L.

If Aesthetics has historically been the realm of thought where universalizing claims of political and self-determining subjecthood demarcated the threshold of the human (and aesthetic) subject in and of representation: how have unfreedom, subjection, social injustice been defined in relation to representation? Taking the Block Exhibition \"Thinking About History\" as a survey of the compelling stories that can be told through works of art, we examine not only who and what gets represented and/or erased but also what constitutes visibility in visual culture, historically and down the present. We interrogate the power dynamics within which the racial and gendered regimes of representation have regulated access to recognition, by fundamentally de-naturalizing the ways in which these regimes have taught us to see.

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of cantos Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio in its cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the underground world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval urban life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Inferno and Purgatorio and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.

Young Jewish men are afforded a glimpse of the intellectual vistas lying beyond the stifling confines of the traditional Jewish shtetl.  Reviled in these traditional communities as \"heretics\" they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This \"imagined community\" was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly. \nIt was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the \"Talush\" (\"the uprooted man\") which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety.\nThe course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day.  In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national \"Home\" brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the \"Talush\" narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y.

Students will also receive explicit constructive criticism from the instructor on regular electronic submissions. This class is a \"hybrid\" course, meaning that 50% of the class is conducted online. Rather than meeting for two and a half hours per week, we meet for only one and a quarter hours, and that face-to-face time is spent working on the issues presented in each weekly unit."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"Students must complete an online form from English Language Programs in order to be eligible for the class and obtain a permission number.

We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations. \n\nThe prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra.

Is democracy always the best political solution (in wartime? general starvation?)? Why should the whole of the people decide and not the specialists in the respective questions? Are all democratically taken decisions automatically legitimate (what about minorities\\' rights?)? How should all citizens in a democracy participate in politics?

At the conclusion of the course, the student should be able to know what it takes to write a successful research assignment not only in philosophy, but quite generally in academic contexts. As a PHILOSOPHY course, the students will learn the core ideals of major classics of democratic theory from Aristotle to Habermas in a historically guided systematic development of the normative ideal \"democratic state\". In this process, they will also learn to apply these (=our) ideals reflectively and critically on contemporary challenges to democratic practice like elite domination, racism and populism. Reading and interpreting the sources will enable them to interpret social scientific and philosophical texts and ideas with fluency.

They thus emphasize volitional, procedural, social, and evolutionary aspects of knowledge of any kind. Given this focus on practically involved intelligent agents, political pragmatists like Dewey, Addams, Locke explore the natural origins, revisability and legitimacy of moral and political norms.

think about it as a \"helping profession\", there is much more than meets the eye when it comes to the psychological, economic, and political forces that have defined the development of the field. The course will focus on the contemporary framework for defining mental illness - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition) - with a particular focus on some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual, and the assumptions that it makes about disorders and typical development. We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry. Some of these themes will also be explored through analysis of popular films and other media.

Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill knowledge of the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of a laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have firsthand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology.

By using the Atlantic ocean as a framing device, we will consider the relationship of Modern Judaism, and religion more broadly, to the histories of slavery and colonialism. This course will pay close attention to how modern interpreters of Jewish texts both shaped and were shaped by racial concepts and ideology, and the varied ways that Jews negotiated the politics of racial difference in the light of gendered, class-based, and interreligious conflicts. We will frequently examine our sources with an eye towards contemporary debates about Jewish identity, thereby raising fascinating and thorny issues about the nature and history of race and racism in Jewish contexts, and the relationship between religion and race in the past and in our own time.\n\nWe begin in the 18th century Caribbean by examining the development of Jewish ritual and communal life amongst the plantations and ports of Suriname, Jamaica, Barbados and the US South. We'll pay close attention to the ways in which Jews negotiated their own autonomy and expressed their Jewishness - through architecture, conversion, circumcision, sexual practices, and ritual performance - in Atlantic societies defined by racial hierarchy and entanglement. We will then move across the ocean and discuss the reception of racial discourses in the scholarly and popular cultures of European Jews. We will encounter modern Jewish versions of the Montaigne's Noble Savage, the Yiddish edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the folktales of \"primitive\" Jewish tribes in \"the East,\" while paying close attention to the ways in which modern Jewish thinkers both used traditional Jewish texts to naturalize racial concepts, while also re-reading their own sources with new critical and intellectual tools. We'll read about the popularization of race science amongst Jewish intellectuals and its instrumentalization in the struggle against racist antisemitism. From there, we will use sources from American television, French cinema, Soviet Yiddish literature, Israeli hip-hop, and Trinidadian calypso to consider the role of race and racism in 20th and 21st century Jewish cultures in the United States, France, Southern Africa, and Palestine/Israel. In all, this course will resist totalizing and essentializing ideas about both Jewish culture and race, and reintroduce students to a crucial element in the construction of modern Judaism."},{"name":"Learning Objectives","desc":"How to use the tools of literary and historical analysis to analyze major aspects of Modern Judaism, including but not limited to Jewish ideas of race, racism, peoplehood, society, difference, and obligation."},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"<ln/>"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"tbd"}]}],"002258":[{"unique_id":"17639","instructors":["Matthew James Chalmers"],"mode":null,"title":"Topics in Christianity","subject":"RELIGION","number":"349-0","section":"20","meeting_days":"MoWe","start_time":"11:00","end_time":"12:20","room":{"building_name":"Locy Hall 303"},"start_date":"2021-09-21","end_date":"2021-12-04","component":"SEM","course_descriptions":[{"name":"Overview of class","desc":"Can a divine being be offended?

Students will also learn skills for understanding novels that will make it easier and more rewarding to read great fiction generally."},{"name":"Registration Requirements","desc":"These are the class attributes listed for this class: \nLiterature & Fine Arts \n\nGiven in English"},{"name":"Teaching Method","desc":"Lectures and discussions"},{"name":"Evaluation Method","desc":"Paper and examination"},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov - Modern Library.\nTolstoy, Anna Karenina - Modern Library.\n\nBe sure to use these editions!!

Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward."},{"name":"Class Materials (Required)","desc":"Cervantes, Miguel de.
