      This is personal project I've been developing over the summer to simplify course scheduling at NU. It started mainly as a way for me to learn react, and I've since decided to release it as I think it could provide value to students. It's heavily inspired by serif, and it shares several of its core features. Please note that salad.nu is in no way a replacement for Caesar, but rather as a tool to visualize your course selections.

      A couple of people have asked what the 'Export' button does. Simply put, it just exports your schedule as a csv which you can then import into google calendar (following these

      ). I recommend performing this step in Chrome, as a few browsers have known bugs with google calendar imports. At this moment, salad.nu only supports google calendar.

      Another quick note: I've received a lot of feature requests for the ability to browse courses by school, subject, etc... I unfortunately won't have time to add this functionality this quater, but you can expect to see it sometime in future. For now, I suggest using the
